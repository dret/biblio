The Visual Book explored the importance of the visual component of the book metaphor in the production of "good" electronic books for referencing. The Hyper-TextBook concentrated on the importance of models and techniques for the automatic production of functional electronic versions of textbooks. Both studies started from similar considerations on what kinds of paper books are suitable for translation into electronic form but di.er on the prominence given to book appearance and functionalities. The results of these two research projects are critically presented in this paper, with the aim of helping designers and implementers to better integrate appearance and functional aspects of books into a more general methodology for the automatic production of electronic books for information access.}

    abstract =  "We present the Lorel language, designed for querying semistructured data. Semistructured data is becoming more and more prevalent, e.g., in structured documents such as HTML and when performing simple integration of data from multiple sources. Traditional data models and query languages are inappropriate, since semistructured data often is irregular: some data is missing, similar concepts are represented using different types, heterogeneous sets are present, or object structure is not fully known. Lorel is a user-friendly language in the SQL/OQL style for querying such data effectively. For wide applicability, the simple object model underlying Lorel can be viewed as an extension of the ODMG data model and the Lorel language as an extension of OQL. The main novelties of the Lorel language are: (i) the extensive use of coercion to relieve the user from the strict typing of OQL, which is inappropriate for semistructured data; and (ii) powerful path expressions, which permit a flexible form of declarative navigational access and are particularly suitable when the details of the structure are not known to the user. Lorel also includes a declarative update language. Lorel is implemented as the query language of the Lore prototype database management system at Stanford. Information about Lore can be found at http://www-db.stanford.edu/lore. In addition to presenting the Lorel language in full, this paper briefly describes the Lore system and query processor. We also briefly discuss a second implementation of Lorel on top of a conventional object-oriented database management system, the O2 system."

    abstract =  {The World Wide Web is a large, heterogeneous, distributed collection of documents connected by hypertext links. The most common technology currently used for searching the Web depends on sending information retrieval requests to "index servers" that index as many documents as they can find by navigating the network. One problem with this is that users must be aware of the various index servers (over a dozen of them are currently deployed on the Web), of their strengths and weaknesses, and of the peculiarities of their query interfaces. A more serious problem is that these queries cannot exploit the structure and topology of the document network. In this paper we propose a query language, WebSQL, that takes advantage of multiple index servers without requiring users to know about them, and that integrates textual retrieval with structure and topology-based queries. We give a formal semantics for WebSQL using a calculus based on a novel "virtual graph" model of a document network. We propose a new theory of query cost based on the idea of "query locality," that is, how much of the network must be visited to answer a particular query. We give an algorithm for characterizing WebSQL queries with respect to query locality. Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of WebSQL written in Java.}

However, despite the efforts of research groups and innovative corporations, still today it is not possible to say that IoT is upon us. This is mainly due to the fact that a unified IoT architecture has not been yet clearly defined and there is no common agreement in defining protocols and standards for all IoT parts. The framework that current IoT platforms use consists mostly in technologies that partially fulfill some of the IoT requirements. While developers employ existing technologies to build the IoT, research groups are working on adapting protocols to the IoT in order to optimize communications. In this paper, we present and compare existing IoT application layer protocols as well as protocols that are utilized to connect the "things" but also end-user applications to the Internet. We highlight IETF's CoAP, IBM's MQTT, HTML 5's Websocket among others, and we argue their suitability for the IoT by considering reliability, security, and energy consumption aspects. Finally, we provide our conclusions for the IoT application layer communications based on the study that we have conducted.}

The right-hand side of a production, called a content model, is both an extended and a restricted regular expression. The semantics of content models for SGML DTDs can be modified by exceptions (XML does not allow exceptions). Inclusion exceptions allow named elements to appear anywhere within the content of a content model, and exclusion exceptions preclude named elements from appearing in the content of a content model. We give precise definitions of the semantics of exceptions, and prove that they do not increase the expressive power of SGML DTDs when we restrict DTDs according to accepted SGML practice. We prove the following results: 1. Exceptions do not increase the expressive power of extended context-free grammars. 2. For each DTD with exceptions, we can obtain a structurally equivalent extended context-free grammar. 3. For each DTD with exceptions, we can construct a structurally equivalent DTD when we restrict the DTD to adhere to accepted SGML practice. 4. Exceptions are a powerful shorthand notation --- eliminating them may cause exponential growth in the size of an extended context-free grammar or of a DTD."

As RSS becomes more and more prevalent as a way to publish and share information, it becomes increasingly important that location and time is described in an interoperable manner so that applications can request, aggregate, share and map spatiotemporally tagged feeds. This paper describes the GeoRSS model and encodings. With every RSS item has a timestamp, GeoRSS can represent time property for free. There are three GeoRSS encoding standards, such as W3C Geo, GeoRSS Simple, and GeoRSS GML profile. These standards differ in the number of coordinate systems they can support, and in the number of different geometric shapes they can add to the map to show where the news or event of interest is taking place. Further more, this paper described how to add time attribute to GeoRSS and implement and visualization the GeoRSS feeds through Google Map and Timeline. A few apt illustrations were given to show the powerful functions of GeoRSS in syndicating the spatiotemporal information. GeoRSS leverages this teeming ecosystem for geospatial technology, and with OGC support, GeoRSS is on firm conceptual ground and gains exposure across the industry."

But even their more enlightened competitors, the ones who've begun to wrap valuable services around their products and, in some cases, profit directly from those services, are enjoying only a temporary advantage. They may be improving their customer relationships by taking on various burdens such as maintenance and replenishment of supplies, but that will get them only so far.

Motivated by new issues that arise in the context of computer supported cooperative work, we aim to integrate formal modelling of undo with an analysis of how users understand undo facilities. Together, these combined perspectives of the system and user lead to concrete design advice for implementing an undo facility. The special issues that arise in the context of shared undo also shed light on the emphasis that should be placed on even single user undo. In particular, we come to regard undo not as a system command to be implemented, but as a user intention to be supported by the system."

The site overview resulted in users abandoning fewer information-seeking tasks. Users with such context dig deeper into the site structure, make less use of the browser's Back button, and frequently make navigational movements of great hierarchical distances. Navigational correlates of success and reported confidence for users with the overview differ from those without such context. Both with and without a constant overview, the relationship between the source and destination pages may help predict the amount of time spent at the destination. Experimental reports are preceded by a review of click-stream navigation behavior research."

Blogs are a typical and popular example of this category. By looking at blogs from a more context-oriented view, it is possible to deconstruct them into structures which are more contextual than just focused on the content, facilitating flexible reuse of these structures. --- Design/Methodology/Approach: We look at the underlying structures of blogs and blog posts, representing them as multi-ended links. This alternative representation of blogs and blog posts allows us to represent them as reusable information structures. This paper presents blogs as a popular content type, but the approach of restructuring Web 2.0 content can be extended to other classes of information, as long as they can be regarded as being mainly contextual. --- Findings: By deconstructing blogs and blog posts into their essential properties, we can show how there is a simple and universal representation for blogs. This representation allows the reuse of blog information across specific blog or blogging platforms, and can even go beyond blogs by representing other Web content which provides context. --- Originality/Value: The approach presented in this paper is a novel approach of mapping a popular Web content type to a simple and universal representation. The value of such a unified representation lies in exposing the structural similarities among blogs and blog posts, and making them available for reuse.}

WAP is becoming the de facto standard for mobile subscribers who want to browse the contents in the Internet and perform e-commerce transactions. At the same time, new capabilities --- such as those provided by intelligent network (IN) technology --- are also being introduced into the public land mobile networks (PLMNs) to provide enhanced services.

This paper describes the evaluation of a "temporal" alternative to the normal "stack-based" behaviour of Back and Forward. The main difference of the temporal scheme is that it maintains a complete list of previously visited pages. The evaluation compares the efficiency of the stack and temporal schemes in an "out of the box" scenario in which participants were asked to use a "new" version of a commercial browser without any explanation of the presence or absence of new features. This scenario allows us to predict the likely usability impact if commercial browsers were released supporting the temporal scheme. The results showed that the relative efficiency of the two schemes differed across different types of navigational task. In particular, the temporal system poorly supported backtracking to parent pages, but performed better for more distant navigation tasks. The temporal scheme also caused extreme usage patterns, with the subjects either solving tasks very efficiently or very inefficiently, depending on whether they used the Back menu. This observation indicates that adaptations of the temporal system that improve the effectiveness of the Back menu may enhance web navigation.}

In this article we suggest a set of guidelines to help computer professionals consider the ethical dimensions of technical decisions and offer practical advice to individuals who need to make timely decisions in an ethical manner. We call our guidelines a paramedic method to suggest a medical analogy. We use our method on two realistic ethical dilemmas facing computer professionals. We gather and analyze the data and reach conclusions much as the principals in our cases might. Our paramedic method is not a replacement for considered analysis by professional ethicists. It is a method by which computer professionals can quickly organize and view the facts of an ethical dilemma in a systematic and practical fashion.}

These new tools, the author contends, may well supplant other communication and knowledge management systems with their superior ability to capture tacit knowledge, best practices and relevant experiences from throughout a company and make them readily available to more users. This article offers a paradigm that highlights the salient characteristics of these new technologies, which the author refers to as SLATES (search, links, authoring, tags, extensions, signals). The resulting organizational communication patterns can lead to highly productive and highly collaborative environments by making both the practices of knowledge work and its outputs more visible. Drawing on case studies and survey data, the article offers managers a set of ground rules for implementing the new technologies. First, it is necessary to create a receptive culture in order to prepare the way for new practices. Second, a common platform must be created to allow for a collaboration infrastructure. Third, an informal rollout of the technologies may be preferred to a more formal procedural change. And fourth, managerial support and leadership is crucial. Even when implanted and implemented well, these new technologies will certainly bring with them new challenges. These tools may well reduce management's ability to exert unilateral control and to express some level of negativity. Whether a company's leaders really want this to happen and will be able to resist the temptation to silence dissent is an open question. Leaders will have to play a delicate role if they want Enterprise 2.0 technologies to succeed."

Instead, ERP systems --- including both software applications and the data they process --- are variegated patchworks, containing 50 or more databases and hundreds of separate software programs installed over decades and interconnected by idiosyncratic, Byzantine, and poorly documented customized processes. To manage this growing complexity, IT departments have grown substantially: Today's IT departments spend 70% to 80% of their budgets just trying to keep existing systems running. The research shows, says the author, that the typical IT structure is so dense and extensive that it's often a miracle that it works at all. Enterprise systems that were supposed to streamline and simplify business processes instead have brought high risks, uncertainty, and a deeply worrying level of complexity. Rather than agility, they have produced rigidity and unexpected barriers to change, a veritable glut of information containing myriad hidden errors, and a cloud of questions regarding their overall benefits. How did this happen? Rettig points to the inherent limitations in the nature of software, the costs of implementation, and the vagaries of data. Indeed, she offers, enterprise software may be just too complex to deliver on its promises. She also suggests that the next new thing --- service-oriented architecture (SOA) --- is not likely to fare much better, for many of the same reasons. There are no easy fixes, cautions Rettig, save a large dose of sobriety, clear-eyed analysis, and emphasis on simplicity and efficiency."

The data are  used to explore three particular problems which users have with browsing the Web. Firstly, users have problems managing their favourites, and in particular accessing their favourites through a hierarchical menu. Second, users have problems with combining information across different Web sites --- what we call the "meta-task" problem. Third, users have concerns with security and privacy, although these concerns seem to change as users become more experienced with shopping on the Web. We discuss three concepts which address these problems: "home page favourites", "Web clipping" and the "Web card".

Thus RE product models use concepts for modelling these instead of concepts like data, process, events, etc., used in conceptual models. Since the former are more stable than the latter, requirements engineering manages change better. The paper gives the rationale for extending traditional conceptual models and introduces some RE product models. Furthermore, in contrast to conceptual modelling, requirements engineering lays great stress on the engineering process employed. The paper introduces some RE process models and considers their effect on tool support."

Their approach is an example of what De Certeau describes as a 'tactic' where scammers manipulate the space of representations produced by hegemonic forces in the West to realize subversive ends. The attempts of Internet scammers highlight the difficulties of creating selfrepresentations that are both 'authentic' and persuasive underlining the complexity inherent in efforts by marginalized communities to be heard by those they perceive as powerful.

In this paper, we extend XML DTDs with several classes of integrity constraints and investigate the complexity of reasoning about these constraints. The constraints range over keys, foreign keys, inverse constraints as well as ID constraints for capturing the semantics of object identities. They improve semantic specifications and provide a better reference mechanism for native XML applications. They are also useful in information exchange and data integration for preserving the semantics of data originating in relational and object-oriented databases. We establish complexity and axiomatization results for the (finite) implication problems associated with these constraints. In addition, we study implication of more general constraints, such as functional, inclusion and inverse constraints defined in terms of navigation paths."

The performance is not as expected: search engines loose information, relevant URLs that were retrieved at a given time by a certain search engine, were not retrieved by the same search engine at a later time, although they continued to exist and to be relevant. A closer examination of the these URLs revealed that not only URLs were dropped, but content was also lost for a large portion of these URLs: no other URL retrieved by the search engine contained the same information. As far as we know this aspect of the performance of search engines has not been thoroughly studied before. The problem is investigated through a case study, using the search phrase "informetrics OR informetric". The searches were carried out in one month intervals during a five months period between January and June 1998. An additional search round and comparison were carried out on June 1999. The six largest search engines at the time were examined.}

Yet search engines are known to only index a fraction of the web, up to a maximum of 16\% in one recent study. A search engine must crawl the web periodically in order to maintain an up to date index, but, given the limitations of total coverage, how can it decide which sites to cover and which to ignore? One answer lies in research showing the importance of web links in identifying useful sources of information. This paper reports on an experiment to investigate the effect of link count on the indexing of 1000 sites in three search portals over a period of seven months. It was found that, although all engines added sites during the period of the survey, only Google showed evidence of being very responsive to the existence of links on the test site, whereas AltaVista's results were very stable over time."

As the primary benefit of hypertext systems is to be able to read documents non-linearly, their expressiveness is defined in terms of the ability to follow links. Then, we classify hypertext systems according to the power of the underlying automaton. The model allows us to compare embedded versus separate links and simple versus generic links. Then, we investigate history mechanisms, adaptive hypertexts and functional links. Our conclusion is that simple links, whether embedded or separate, generic links and some adaptive links all give hypertext systems the power of finite state automata. The history mechanism confers to them the power of pushdown automata, whereas the general functional links give them Turing completeness."

We propose a distributed, infrastructure-free positioning algorithm that does not rely on GPS (Global Positioning System). Instead, the algorithm uses the distances between the nodes to build a relative coordinate system in which the node positions are computed in two dimensions. Despite the distance measurement errors and the motion of the nodes, the algorithm provides sufficient location information and accuracy to support basic network functions. Examples of applications where this algorithm can be used include Location Aided Routing and Geodesic Packet Forwarding. Another example are sensor networks, where mobility is less of a problem. The main contribution of this work is to define and compute relative positions of the nodes in an ad hoc network without using GPS. We further explain how the proposed approach can be applied to wide area ad hoc networks."

OWL-QL is a formal language and precisely specifies the semantic relationships among a query, a query answer, and the knowledge base(s) used to produce the answer. Unlike standard database and Web query languages, OWL-QL supports query-answering dialogues in which the answering agent may use automated reasoning methods to derive answers to queries, as well as dialogues in which the knowledge to be used in answering a query may be in multiple knowledge bases on the Semantic Web, and/or where those knowledge bases are not specified by the querying agent.

This problem is not only currently pervasive on the Web, but is also important to the emerging Semantic Web. A straightforward approach to automating this process would be to build classifiers through machine learning and then use these classifiers to classify objects from the source taxonomies into categories of the master taxonomy. However, conventional machine learning algorithms totally ignore the availability of the source taxonomies. In fact, source and master taxonomies often have common categories under different names or other more complex semantic overlaps. We introduce two techniques that exploit the semantic overlap between the source and master taxonomies to build better classifiers for the master taxonomy. The first technique, Cluster Shrinkage, biases the learning algorithm against splitting source categories by making objects in the same category appear more similar to each other. The second technique, Co-Bootstrapping, tries to facilitate the exploitation of inter-taxonomy relationships by providing category indicator functions as additional features for the objects. Our experiments with real-world Web data show that these proposed add-on techniques can enhance various machine learning algorithms to achieve substantial improvements in performance for taxonomy integration."

Different encoding mechanisms like Extended Data Representation (XDR), Network Data Representation (NDR) and Common Data Representation (CDR) facilitate inter-component communication transparently and efficiently. Marshalling procedures convert data in local machine representation into common network representations. Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) uses CDR representation to encode data. This paper proposes certain changes that can be incorporated in the CDR encoding mechanism, to achieve better efficiency in transmission. The changes include the following: A bit representation for the boolean array; Removing data alignment at word boundaries; Exact allocation of send and receive buffer space depending on the data type being transmitted; Adopting inlining mechanism for some primitive data types to improve efficiency."

We present a taxonomy that covers many of these existing approaches, and we describe the approaches in some detail. In particular,we distinguish between schema-level and instance-level, element-level and structure-level, and language-based and constraint-based matchers. Based on our classification we review some previous match implementations thereby indicating which part of the solution space they cover.We intend our taxonomy and review of past work to be useful when comparing different approaches to schema matching, when developing a new match algorithm, and when implementing a schema matching component."

For the foreseeable future, however, most business data will continue to be stored in relational database systems. Consequently, if XML is to fulfill its potential, some mechanism is needed to publish relational data as XML documents. Towards that goal, one of the major challenges is finding a way to efficiently structure and tag data from one or more tables as a hierarchical XML document. Different alternatives are possible depending on when this processing takes place and how much of it is done inside the relational engine. In this paper, we characterize and study the performance of these alternatives. Among other things, we explore the use of new scalar and aggregate functions in SQL for constructing complex XML documents directly in the relational engine. We also explore different execution plans for generating the content of an XML document. The results of an experimental study show that constructing XML documents inside the relational engine can have a significant performance benefit. Our results also show the superiority of having the relational engine use what we call an "outer union plan" to generate the content of an XML document.}

Future development directions for KM performance evaluation are presented in our discussion. They include: (1) KM performance measurements have tended towards expertise orientation, while evaluation development is a problem-orientated domain; (2) different  information technology methodologies, such as expert systems, knowledge-based systems and case-based reasoning may be able to evaluate KM as simply another  methodology; (3) the ability to continually change and obtain new understanding is the driving power behind KM methodologies, and should be the basis of KM performance evaluations in the future."

We present XSugar, which makes it possible to manage dual syntax for XML languages. An XSugar specification is built around a context-free grammar that unifies the two syntaxes of a language. Given such a specification, the XSugar tool can translate from alternative syntax to XML and vice versa. Moreover, the tool statically checks that the transformations are reversible and that all XML documents generated from the alternative syntax are valid according to a given XML schema."

    abstract =  "One of the most visible trends on the Web is the emergence of Social Web sites, which help people create and gather knowledge by simplifying user contributions via blogs, tagging and folksonomies, wikis, podcasts, and online social networks. Current online-community sites are isolated from one another, like islands in a sea. Various discussions might contain complementary knowledge and discussion --- parts of the answer a person is looking for --- but people participating in one discussion can't readily access information about related discussions elsewhere. The potential synergies among many sites, communities, and services are expensive to exploit, and their data are difficult and cumbersome to link and reuse. The main reason for this lack of interoperation is that for the most part in the Social Web, common standards still don't exist for knowledge and information exchange and interoperation. However, the Semantic Web effort aims to provide the tools needed to define extensible, flexible standards for this purpose. The Semantic Web technology stack is well defined, enabling the creation of metadata and associated vocabularies. The Semantic Web effort is in an ideal position to make Social Web sites interoperable. Applying Semantic Web frameworks including SIOC (Semantically Interlinked Online Communities) and FOAF (Friend-of-a-Friend) to the Social Web can lead to a Social Semantic Web, creating a network of interlinked and semantically rich knowledge. This article is part of a special issue called Semantic Web Update."

The Semantic Web is a Web of actionable information --- information derived from data through a semantic theory for interpreting the symbols. This simple idea, however, remains largely unrealized. Shopbots and auction bots abound on the Web, but these are essentially handcrafted for particular tasks; they have little ability to interact with heterogeneous data and information types. Because we haven't yet delivered large-scale, agent-based mediation, some commentators argue that the Semantic Web has failed to deliver. We argue that agents can only flourish when standards are well established and that the Web standards for expressing shared meaning have progressed steadily over the past five years. Furthermore, we see the use of ontologies in the e-science community presaging ultimate success for the Semantic Web --- just as the use of HTTP within the CERN particle physics community led to the revolutionary success of the original Web.

Context awareness means to take the users' context such as location, time, objective, community relations, etc., into account when browsing, searching, annotating, and linking. Attributes constituting the context of the user may be sensed automatically and/or be provided by the user directly. When mobile, the user may obtain context-aware hypermedia support on a variety of small and medium sized computing platforms such as mobile phones, PDAs, tablet PCs, and laptops. This paper introduces the HyCon (HyperContext) framework with an architecture for context-aware hypermedia. The architecture includes interfaces for a sensor tier encapsulating relevant sensors and represents the hypermedia objects in structures based on the XLink and RDF standards. A prototype called the HyConExplorer created with the framework is presented, and it is illustrated how the classical hypermedia features such as browsing, searching, annotating, linking, and collaboration are supported in context-aware hypermedia. Among the features of the HyConExplorer are real-time location-based searches via Google collecting hits within a specified nimbus around the user's GPS position. Finally, the use of scenarios for and evaluation of the use of the HyConExplorer in public school projects are discussed."

    abstract =  {The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and the Extensible Markup Language (XML) allow authors to better transmit the semantics in their documents by explicitly specifying the relevant structures in a document or class of documents by means of document type definitions (DTDs). Several authors have proposed to regard DTDs as extended context-free grammars expressed in a notation similar to extended Backus-Naur form. In addition, the SGML standard allows the semantics of content models (the right-hand side of productions) to be modified by exceptions. Inclusion exceptions allow named elements to appear anywhere within the content of a content model, and exclusion exceptions preclude named elements from appearing in the content of a content model. Since XML does not allow exceptions, the problem of exception removal has received much interest recently. Motivated by this, Kilpel\"ainen and Wood have proved that exceptions do not increase the expressive power of extended context-free grammars and that for each DTD with exceptions, we can obtain a structurally equivalent extended context-free grammar. Since their argument was based on an exponential simulation, they also conjectured that an exponential blow-up in the size of the grammar is a necessary devil when purging exceptions away. We prove their conjecture under the most realistic assumption that NP-complete problems do not admit non-uniform polynomial-time algorithms. Kilpel\"ainen and Wood also asked whether the parsing problem for extended context-free grammars with exceptions admits efficient algorithmic solution. We show the NP-completeness of the very basic problem: given a string w and a context-free grammar G (not even extended) with exclusion exceptions (no inclusion exceptions needed), decide whether w belongs to the language generated by G. Our results and arguments point up the limitations of using extended context-free grammars as a model of SGML, especially when one is interested in understanding issues related to exceptions.}

Following this analogy, sophisticated application environments on the World Wide Web will require third- and fourth-generation hypermedia features. Implementing third- and fourth-generation hypermedia involves designing both high-level hypermedia features and the high-level authoring environments system developers build for authors to specify them. We present a set of high-level hypermedia features including typed nodes and links, link attributes, structure-based query, transclusions, warm and hot links, private and public links, hypermedia access permissions, computed personalized links, external link databases, link update mechanisms, overviews, trails, guided tours, backtracking, and history-based navigation. We ground our discussion in the hypermedia research literature, and illustrate each feature both from existing implementations and a running scenario. We also give some direction for implementing these on the World Wide Web and in other information systems."

Many of the reasons are technical: poor architecture, complex APIs, and lack of essential features all contributed to CORBA's downfall. However, such technical shortcomings are a symptom rather than a cause. Ultimately, CORBA failed because its standardization process virtually guarantees poor technical quality. Seeing that other standards consortia use a process that is very similar, this does not bode well for the viability of other technologies produced in this fashion."

This rich toolset has caused schema designers to wonder which features they should or should not use. If we analyze what people are actually implementing, perhaps we can glean some guidance.

XML Inclusions (XInclude) is the W3C standard which has been created to support this scenario, but since it is a standalone specification, it needs to be supported by a piece of software implementing this functionality. The XInclude Processor (XIPr) written in XSLT 2.0 implements XInclude and thus may help to reduce the dependency on numerous software packages, if XInclude should be used in an environment where XSLT 2.0 is used anyway. XIPr is implemented as a single XSLT 2.0 stylesheet and can be used standalone in a publishing pipeline, or as an imported module in some other XSLT code for integrated XInclude processing."

We give two characterizations of languages generated by XML-grammars, one is set-theoretic, the other is by a kind of saturation property.

High-quality conceptual modeling work is important because it facilitates early detection and correction of system development errors. It also plays an increasingly important role in activities like business process reengineering and documentation of best-practice data and process models in enterprise resource planning systems. Yet little research has been undertaken on many aspects of conceptual modeling. In this paper, we propose a framework to motivate research that addresses the following fundamental question: How can we model the world to better facilitate our developing, implementing, using, and maintaining more valuable information systems? The framework comprises four elements: conceptual-modeling grammars, conceptual-modeling methods, conceptual-modeling scripts, and conceptual-modeling contexts. We provide examples of the types of research that have already been undertaken on each element and illustrate research opportunities that exist."

In today's computing world, the barriers take the form of incompatible bibliographic formats and constraining operating system and vendor dependencies. These incompatible platforms isolate the respective camps. In this paper, we demonstrate and discuss a new approach to unify citation management, called the Open Citation System (OCS). OCS uses open XML standards and Java component technologies. By providing converter tools to migrate citations to a centralized "hub" in BiblioML format (an XML tag set based on the UniMARC standard), we then make use of XML Topic Maps to provide an extensible framework for visualization. We take as an example the ACM Classification Code and show how the OCS system displays citations in a convenient focus + context hyperbolic tree interface. We conclude by discussing future directions planned to extend the OCS system and how open citation management can supply an important piece in our inexorable march towards a worldwide digital library.}

    abstract =  "Large scale research Digital Libraries (DLs) have a large array of potentially useful metadata. Yet, many popular DLs do not provide a convenient way to navigate the metadata or to visualize classification schema in the user session. For example, in the broad world of Management Information Systems (MIS) research, a high-level overview of MIS topics and their interrelationships would be useful to navigate a MIS DL before zooming in on a specific article. To address this obstacle, this paper describes a prototype, the Technical Report Visualizer System (TRV), which uses a wide variety of open standards to expose DL classification metadata in the navigation interface. The system captures MIS article metadata from the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) compliant arXiv e-Print archive at Cornell University. The OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is used to collect the topic metadata; the articles' Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Computing Classification System codes. We display the topic metadata in a Java hyperbolic tree and make use of XML conceptual product and implementation product standards and specifications, such as the Dublin Core and BiblioML bibliographic metadata sets, XML Topic Maps, Xalan and Xerces, to link user navigation activity to the abstracts and full text contents of the articles. We discuss the flexibility and convenience of XML standards and link this effort to related digital library visualization approaches."

First, we define time graphs to extend the traditional notion of an evolving directed graph, capturing link creation as a point phenomenon in time. Second, we develop definitions and algorithms for time-dense community tracking, to crystallize the notion of community evolution. We develop these tools in the context of Blogspace, the space of weblogs (or blogs). Our study involves approximately 750 K links among 25 K blogs. We create a time graph on these blogs by an automatic analysis of their internal time stamps. We then study the evolution of connected component structure and microscopic community structure in this time graph. We show that Blogspace underwent a transition behavior around the end of 2001, and has been rapidly expanding, not just in metrics of scale but also in metrics of community structure and connectedness. By randomizing link destinations in Blogspace, but retaining sources and timestamps, we introduce a concept of randomized Blogspace. Herein, we observe similar evolution of a giant component, but no corresponding increase in community structure. Having demonstrated the formation of micro-communities over time, we then turn to the ongoing activity within active communities. We extend recent work of Kleinberg (2002) to discover dense periods of "bursty" intra-community link creation. Furthermore, we find that the blogs that give rise to these communities are significantly more enduring than an average blog.}

    abstract =  "Most documents available over the Web conform to the HTML specification. Such documents are hierarchically structured in nature. The existing data models for the Web either fail to capture the hierarchical structure within the documents or can only provide a very low level representation of such hierarchical structure. How to represent and query HTML documents at a higher level is an important issue. In this paper, we first propose a novel conceptual model for HTML. This conceptual model has only a few simple constructs but is able to represent the complex hierarchical structure within HTML documents at a level that is close to human conceptualization/visualization of the documents. We also describe how to convert HTML documents based on this conceptual model. Using the conceptual model and conversion method, one can capture the essence (i.e., semistructure) of HTML documents in a natural and simple way. Based on this conceptual model, we then present a rule-based language to query HTML documents over the Internet. This language provides a simple but very powerful way to query both intra-document structures and inter-document structures and allows the query results to be restructured. Being rule-based, it naturally supports negation and recursion and therefore is more expressive than SQL-based languages. A logical semantics is also provided."

Adaptive Web sites mine the data buried in Web server logs to produce more easily navigable Web sites. To demonstrate the feasibility of adaptive Web sites, the paper considers the problem of index page synthesis and sketches a solution that relies on novel clustering and conceptual clustering techniques. Our preliminary experiments show that high-quality candidate index pages can be generated automatically, and that our techniques outperform existing methods (including the Apriori algorithm, K-means clustering, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and COBWEB) in this domain."

This can make it possible to create complex systems from simple, independent, reusable modules. Debugging and modifying programs, reconfiguring I/O devices, and managing large programming projects can all be greatly simplified. And, as the module library grows, increasingly sophisticated programs can be implemented using less and less new code."

We wanted to design a discipline of service science in a principled and theoretically motivated way. We began our work by asking, "What questions would a service science have to answer?" and from that we developed a new framework for understanding service science. This framework can be visualized as a matrix whose rows are stages in a service life cycle and whose columns are disciplines that can provide answers to the questions that span the life cycle. This matrix systematically organizes the issues and challenges of service science and enables us to compare our model of a service science discipline with other definitions and curricula. This analysis identified gaps, overlaps, and opportunities that shaped the design of our curriculum and in particular a new survey course that serves as the cornerstone of service science education at UC Berkeley.}

With XML (Extensible Markup Language) rapidly becoming the de facto standard for retrieving and exchanging data, new functionality is expected from traditional databases. Existing SQL applications will evolve to retrieve relational data as XML data using database or SQL extensions for XML. New XML data will be stored, searched, and manipulated in the database as a "first class" citizen along with existing relational data. Furthermore, new applications will emerge that solely operate in terms of XML. These new XML applications operate on the same database using an XML query language, XQuery. In this paper, we describe an integrated database architecture that enables SQL applications with XML extensions as well as XQuery applications to operate on the same data. The architecture allows for a seamless flow from relational data to XML and back.}

In such scenarios, XML is often constrained by an XML Schema grammar, which can be used during parsing to improve performance. Although traditional grammar-based parser generation techniques could be applied to the XML Schema grammar, the expressiveness of XML Schema does not lend itself well to the generic intermediate representations associated with these approaches. In this paper we present a method for generating efficient parsers by using the schema component model itself as the representation of the grammar. We show that the model supports the full expressive power of the XML Schema, and we present results demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing parsers."

    abstract =  {Extensible Markup Language (XML) has grown rapidly over the last decade to become the de facto standard for heterogeneous data exchange. Its popularity is due in large part to the ease with which diverse kinds of information can be represented as a result of the self-describing nature and extensibility of XML itself. The ease and speed with which information can be represented does not extend, however, to exchanging such information between autonomous sources. In the absence of controlling standards, such sources will typically choose differing XML representations for the same concept, and the actual exchange of information between them requires that the representation produced by one source be transformed into a representation understood by the other. Creating this information exchange "glue" is a tedious and error-prone process, whether expressed as Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT), XQuery, Java, Structured Query Language (SQL), or some other format. In this paper, we present an extensible XML mapping architecture that elevates XML mapping technology to a fundamental integration component that promotes code generation, mapping reuse, and mapping as metadata.}

We illustrate the applicability of virtual XML through a number of use cases in various environments. We discuss the products that we expect from vendors and the open-source community and the way enterprises can plan to take advantage of virtual XML developments. Finally, we outline future research directions that include a vision of virtual XML that covers large-scale structures such as entire file systems, databases, or even the World Wide Web."

While the field is obviously still in the process of development, there is a marked ambiguity about the exact focus of the field. This lack of focus may hinder its further development and lead to its dissipation. In this paper we set out an approach to CSCW as a field of research which we believe provides a coherent conceptual framework for this area, suggesting that it should be concerned with the support requirements of cooperative work arrangements. This provides a more principled, comprehensive, and, in our opinion, more useful conception of the field than that provided by the conception of CSCW as being focused on computer support for groups. We then investigate the consequences of taking this alternative conception seriously, in terms of research directions for the field. As an indication of the fruits of this approach, we discuss the concept of 'articulation work' and its relevance to CSCW. This raises a host of interesting problems that are marginalized in the work on small group support but critical to the success of CSCW systems 'in the large', i. e., that are designed to meet current work requirements in the everyday world."

We prove that both the data complexity and the query complexity of XPath 1.0 fall into lower (highly parallelizable) complexity classes, while the combined complexity is PTIME-hard. Subsequently, we study the sources of this hardness and identify a large and practically important fragment of XPath 1.0 for which the combined complexity is LOGCFL-complete and, therefore, in the highly parallelizable complexity class NC2. The second problem is the complexity of validating XML documents against various typing schemes like Document Type Definitions (DTDs), XML Schema Definitions (XSDs), and tree automata, both with respect to data and to combined complexity. For data complexity, we prove that validation is in LOGSPACE and depends crucially on how XML data is represented. For the combined complexity, we show that the complexity ranges from LOGSPACE to LOGCFL, depending on the typing scheme."

Under this view, the classical formalism of attribute grammars becomes a formalism for structured document query languages. From this perspective, we study the expressive power of BAGs: Boolean-valued attribute grammars with propositional logic formulas as semantic rules, and RAGs: relation-valued attribute grammars with first-order logic formulas as semantic rules. BAGs can express only unary queries; RAGs can express queries of any arity. We first show that the (unary) queries expressible by BAGs are precisely those definable in monadic second-order logic. We then show that the queries expressible by RAGs are precisely those definable by first-order inductions of linear depth, or, equivalently, those computable in linear time on a parallel machine with polynomially many processors. Further, we show that RAGs that only use synthesized attributes are strictly weaker than RAGs that use both synthesized and inherited attributes. We show that RAGs are more expressive than monadic second-order logic for queries of any arity. Finally, we discuss relational attribute grammars in the context of BAGs and RAGs. We show that in the case of BAGs this does not increase the expressive power, while different semantics for relational RAGs capture the complexity classes NP, coNP and the intersection of UP and coUP."

    abstract =  {Google Maps, Yahoo! Mail, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, and Amazon are examples of Web sites built to scale. They access petabytes of data sending terabits per second to millions of users worldwide. The magnitude is awe-inspiring. Users view these large-scale Web sites from a narrower perspective. The typical user has megabytes of data that they download at a few hundred kilobits per second. Users are less interested in the massive number of requests per second being served, caring more about their individual requests. As they use these Web applications they inevitably ask the same question: "Why is this site so slow?" The answer hinges on where development teams focus their performance improvements. Performance for the sake of scalability is rightly focused on the backend. Database tuning, replicating architectures, customized data caching, and so on, allow Web servers to handle a greater number of requests. This gain in efficiency translates into reductions in hardware costs, data center rack space, and power consumption. But how much does the backend affect the user experience in terms of latency? The Web applications listed here are some of the most highly tuned in the world, and yet they still take longer to load than we'd like. It almost seems as if the high-speed storage and optimized application code on the backend have little impact on the end user's response time. Therefore, to account for these slowly loading pages we must focus on something other than the backend: we must focus on the frontend.}

With great power, however, comes great responsibility, so while XML's success is well earned as the first truly universal standard for structured data, it must now deal with numerous problems that have grown up around it. These are not entirely the fault of XML itself, but instead can be attributed to exaggerated claims and ideas of what XML is and what it can do."

    abstract =  {The classical approach to the data aspect of system design distinguishes conceptual, logical, and physical models. Models of each type or level are governed by metamodels that specify the kinds of concepts and constraints that can be used by each model; in most cases metamodels are accompanied by languages for describing models. For example, in database design, conceptual models usually conform to the Entity-Relationship (ER) metamodel (or some extension of it), the logical model maps ER models to relational tables and introduces normalization, and the physical model handles implementation issues such as possible denormalizations in the context of a particular database schema language. In this modeling methodology, there is a single hierarchy of models that rests on the assumption that one data model spans all modeling levels and applies to all the applications in some domain. The "one true model" approach assumes homogeneity, but this does not work very well for the Web. The Web as a constantly growing ecosystem of heterogeneous data and services has challenged a number of practices and theories about the design of IT landscapes. Instead of being governed by "one true model" used by everyone, the underlying assumption of top-down design, Web data and services evolve in an uncoordinated fashion. As a result, a fundamental challenge with Web data and services is matching and mapping local and often partial models that not only are different models of the same application domain, but also differ, implicitly or explicitly, in their associated metamodels.}

But its information is delivered in format-oriented, handcrafted Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), making it understandable only through human eyes. Software agents and search engines have difficulty using the information because it is not semantically encoded. Clever programmers work around some of HTML's inherent limitations by using proprietary tags or software that "scrapes" Web pages to extract content. Unfortunately, such ad hoc approaches do not scale. Proprietary tags require browser plug-ins, and scraping approaches require a customized script for each Web site. These approaches balkanize the Web, making it inaccessible to agents.}

A major stumbling block to reaping the promised benefits is learning the OO approach. One reason that learning OO is so difficult may be that we do not yet thoroughly understand the fundamental concepts that define the OO approach. When reviewing the body of work on OO development, most authors simply suggest a set of concepts that characterize OO, and move on with their research or discussion. Thus, they are either taking for granted that the concepts are known or implicitly acknowledging that a universal set of concepts does not exist. Several authors, asserting there is no clear definition of the essence of OO, have called for the development of a consensus. While a few have tried to develop such a consensus, to date a thorough review of the literature and identification of the fundamental concepts of the OO approach has been lacking. The goal of this article is twofold: to identify and describe the fundamental concepts, or quarks, of object-oriented development, and identify how these concepts fit together into a coherent scheme."

For success without extensive training, or in first-tries for new targets, the system must recognize terms that will be chosen spontaneously. We studied spontaneous word choice for objects in five application-related domains, and found the variability to be surprisingly large. In every case two people favored the same term with probability <0.20. Simulations show how this fundamental property of language limits the success of various design methodologies for vocabulary-driven interaction. For example, the popular approach in which access is via one designer's favorite single word will result in 80-90 percent failure rates in many common situations. An optimal strategy, unlimited aliasing, is derived and shown to be capable of several-fold improvements."

The effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.}

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as' a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing non inferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sub language are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model."

This has two important consequences: Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. A message can be "signed" using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic funds transfer" systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.}

By using ShaRef, users can share bibliographic information and collaborate, publish and export data using a variety of output channels.

In addition, currently, server push is usually emulated using pull technology, as HTTP protocol alone is not sufficient to realize a real push. This paper evaluates how an instant messaging protocol, namely XMPP, can complement HTTP-based web applications. We present a communication paradigm of a push system and an implementation of it. In addition, another communication paradigm is sketched for inter-widget messaging on the Web. Based on that paradigm a new research problem is defined and presented."

This paper looks at the availability of Web site metadata on today's Web in terms of available information resources and quantitative aspects of their contents. Such an analysis of the available Web site metadata not only makes it easier to understand what data is available today; it also serves as the foundation for investigating what kind of information retrieval processes could be driven by that data, and what additional data could be provided by Web sites if they had richer data formats to publish metadata."

The goal of this approach is to foster as much cooperation as possible, while simultaneously supporting users with individualized ways of reusing the cooperatively managed data. This way of building applications combines the beneficial aspects of information sharing and personalization. Using this approach, applications are better suited to become building blocks in information infrastructures that are built by users in unpredictable ways."

The paper argues that focusing on the development of tools that offer support to hypertext authors for specific tasks is a necessary first step for the introduction of sophisticated hypertext features into the Web. Following a brief history of interaction with the Web, we demonstrate why authoring tools for the Web are a critical target for efforts to extend the use of hypertexts in the Web. We introduce indirect authoring as a label for a shared characteristic of different approaches that try to reduce the complexity and cognitive overhead involved in authoring hypertext. Drawing on this analysis, we lay out some consequences for hypertext research. We provide pointers to projects that have started to experiment with indirect authoring, and list immediate research questions. Developing a diversity of task-oriented authoring tools to reduce the cognitive overhead for authoring hypertexts could change the face of the Web.}

    abstract =  "Currently, the Open Hypermedia Systems (OHS) Working Group claims three main areas of interest: scenarios, reference architectures, and protocols. The discussions over scenarios of OHS use are supposed to inform the work on OHS reference architectures, which in turn is supposed to enable the development of an Open Hypermedia Protocol (OHP) that will allow clients of one OHP-compliant OHS to use services of other OHP-compliant OHS's. In this paper, we start from existing proposals for an OHS reference architecture and an OHP. We then present a number of scenarios that motivate modifications to these existing proposals. These modifications primarily include adding the notion of an open structure processing layer to the reference architecture and adding a fixed minimal set of guaranteed services to the protocol. We then present our resultant reference architecture and protocol proposals. Our proposals are based on current working group proposals, but incorporate the modifications suggested by our scenarios. Finally, we conclude with some comments on the process we used to derive our proposals, an evaluation of current progress of the OHS Working Group, and suggestions for future directions."

Open hypermedia systems share the property of being able to provide non-hypermedia applications with hypermedia structuring and navigation capabilities. This support is currently provided in many different ways. To be able to standardize communication interfaces, it is necessary to develop common understanding of the different architectures of existing systems and to develop a common reference architecture for open hypermedia systems. A reference architecture should provide a common language for the design of open hypermedia systems in terms of architectural elements and interfaces. The paper identifies a number of important requirements and characteristics for open hypermedia systems and examines some of the most well known open hypermedia architectures and reference models. The analysis illuminates the commonalties and differences in terminology and architectural elements. The analytical results are used to propose common terminology and a common reference architecture for open hypermedia systems (CoReArc). CoReArc identifies several different architectural elements and communication interfaces for potential interface standardization. Interface standardization may be achieved through a single physical protocol with several suites or topics or through several independent protocols. CoReArc can be used to identify and discuss the different communication interfaces of an open hypermedia system."

The Harmony international digital library project has developed a common underlying data model (the ABC model) to enable the scalable mapping of metadata descriptions across domains and media types. The ABC model provides a set of basic building blocks for metadata modeling and recognizes the importance of 'events' to describe unambiguously metadata for objects with a complex history. To test and evaluate the interoperability capabilities of this model, we applied it to some real multimedia examples and analysed the results of mapping from the ABC model to various different metadata domains using XSLT. This work revealed serious limitations in the ability of XSLT to support flexible dynamic semantic mapping. To overcome this, we developed MetaNet, a metadata term thesaurus which provides the additional semantic knowledge that is non-existent within declarative XML-encoded metadata descriptions. This paper describes MetaNet, its RDF Schema representation and a hybrid mapping approach which combines the structural and syntactic mapping capabilities of XSLT with the semantic knowledge of MetaNet, to enable flexible and dynamic mapping among metadata standards."

    abstract =  {We suggest that building "permissive, but robust" digital library systems and services is an attractive alternative to the library and computer science tradition of building "strict, but fragile" systems. Strict, but fragile, systems are efforts to engineer complete systems that ensure desired properties, but which often prove impractical in distributed environments without a central authority to coordinate change. In the permissive, but robust, approach, we permit individual components to change in ways that might, in fact, cause a desired property to fail to persist. However, we engineer components to be robust, so that it is likely that desired properties persist even under a great deal of uncoordinated change. We have applied the permissive, but robust, approach to two related problems of reference in distributed information systems. The first application yields robust hyperlinks, and the second, robust locations. Robust hyperlinks address the familiar issue of providing persistent reference to networked resources, such as Web pages, given changing, uncooperating services. Robust locations concern a somewhat less familiar, but, we suspect, soon-to-be just as big a problem, namely, references to changing sub-document resources. Robust locations, we suggest, provide essential grounding for next-generation web functionality, such as annotations that survive document editing. In both cases, robustness is achieved by providing multiple, independent descriptions across boundaries where change is likely to be uncoordinated. If the different descriptions are property selected, then most uncoordinated changes will be unlikely to cause all the descriptions to fail. Thus, while there is no guarantee that references will remain coherent, a single failure is unlikely to be catastrophic. Instead, the failure of one, even a primary, method will generally allow graceful recovery via other methods.}

The OAI-PMH achieves this by providing a simple, yet powerful framework for metadata harvesting. Harvesters can incrementally gather records contained in OAI-PMH repositories and use them to create services covering the content of several repositories. The OAI-PMH has been widely accepted, and until recently, it has mainly been applied to make Dublin Core metadata about scholarly objects contained in distributed repositories searchable through a single user interface. This article describes innovative applications of the OAI-PMH that we have introduced in recent projects. In these projects, OAI-PMH concepts such as resource and metadata format have been interpreted in novel ways. The result of doing so illustrates the usefulness of the OAI-PMH beyond the typical resource discovery using Dublin Core metadata. Also, through the inclusion of XSL  stylesheets in protocol responses, OAI-PMH repositories have been directly overlaid with an interface that allows users to navigate the contained metadata by means of a Web browser. In addition, through the introduction of PURL2 partial redirects, complex OAI-PMH protocol requests have been turned into simple URIs that can more easily be published and used in downstream applications."

The basic ideas of MDA are germane to many other approaches such as generative programming, domain specific languages, model-integrated computing, generic model management, software factories, etc. MDA may be defined as the realization of MDE principles around a set of OMG standards like MOF, XMI, OCL, UML, CWM, SPEM, etc. MDE is presently making several promises about the potential benefits that could be reaped from a move from code-centric to model-based practices. When we observe these claims, we may wonder when they may be satisfied: on the short, medium or long term or even never perhaps for some of them. This paper tries to propose a vision of the development of MDE based on some lessons learnt in the past 30 years in the development of object technology. The main message is that a basic principle ("Everything is an object") was most helpful in driving the technology in the direction of simplicity, generality and power of integration. Similarly in MDE, the basic principle that "Everything is a model" has many interesting properties, among others the capacity to generate a realistic research agenda. We postulate here that two core relations (representation and conformance) are associated to this principle, as inheritance and instantiation were associated to the object unification principle in the class-based languages of the 80's. We suggest that this may be most useful in understanding many questions about MDE in general and the MDA approach in particular. We provide some illustrative examples. The personal position taken in this paper would be useful if it could generate a critical debate on the research directions in MDE.}

Axioms and relationships among elements in the collection as well as structural and integrity constraints are formalized as XML clauses. An XML database, consisting of: (i) a document collection (or an extensional database), (ii) a set of axioms and relationships (or an intensional database), (iii) a set of integrity constraints, is therefore modeled as an XML declarative description comprising a set of ground XML expressions and XML clauses. Its semantics is a set of ground XML expressions, which are explicitly described by the extensional database or implicitly derived from the database, based on the defined intensional database, and satisfy all the specified set of constraints. Thus, selective and complex queries, formulated as sets of XML clauses, about information satisfying specific criteria and possibly implicit in the database, become expressible and computable. The model thereby serves as an effective and well-founded XML database management framework with succinct representational and operational uniformity, reasoning capabilities as well as complex and deductive query supports."

However, underneath it lie some fundamental concepts, including the writeable web, increased audience participation, and a move away from traditional 'click and wait' web applications, in which input was delivered on a page by page basis. Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a programming mechanism that has enabled developers to deliver a better experience to web users. However, just as basic JavaScript validation mechanisms did before it, Ajax-based applications may be subject to abuse by intruders who can launch attacks designed to bypass login scripts, for example. Programmers and project managers must come to terms with the tension between a better user experience and the potential for security flaws. One way to resolve them is to use robust coding techniques to protect applications."

Hence the focus of rewrite optimization is to consolidate navigation constructs as much as possible and to pushdown comparison predicates and navigation constructs into data access to enable index usage. In this paper, we describe the new rewrite transformations we have implemented specifically for XQuery and its navigational constructs. We also briefly discuss how some of the existing rewrite transformations developed for the SQL engine are extended and adapted for XQuery."

    abstract =  "Since the birth of XML, the processing of XML query languages like XQuery/XQueryP has been widely researched in the academic and industrial communities. Most of the approaches consider XQuery as a declarative query language similar to SQL, for which the iterator-based (stream-based), lazy evaluation processing strategy can be applied. The processing is combined with XML indexing, materialized view, XML view query rewrite over source data. An alternative approach views XQuery as a procedural programming language associated with eager, step-based evaluation, where each expression is fully evaluated by the end of the corresponding expression execution step. Usually, this approach uses a virtual machine running byte-code for compiled programs. In this paper, we share our experience of building a unified XQuery engine for the Oracle XML DB integrating both approaches. The key contribution of our approach is that the unified XQuery processor integrates both declarative and imperative XQuery/XQueryP processing paradigms. Furthermore, the processor is designed with a clean separation between the logical XML data model and the physical representation so that it can be optimized with various physical XML storages and data index and view models. We also discuss the challenges in our approach and our overall vision of the evolution of XQuery/XQueryP processors."

We can categorize the numerous approaches explored into two groups: universal user interface languages and user interface remoting.

At the end of the semester, students preferred PowerPoint presentations but this preference was not found on ratings taken immediately after the lectures. Students performed worse on quizzes when PowerPoint presentations included non-text items such as pictures and sound effects. A second study further examined these findings. In this study participants were shown PowerPoint slides that contained only text, contained text and a relevant picture, and contained text with a picture that was not relevant. Students performed worse on recall and recognition tasks and had greater dislike for slides with pictures that were not relevant. We conclude that PowerPoint can be beneficial, but material that is not pertinent to the presentation can be harmful to students' learning."

There are no-cost Open Source Software (OSS) alternatives to proprietary software for operating systems, web servers, and Relational Database Management Systems. We tested the potential of the combined use of OS and OSS to create web-based spatial information solutions. We present in detail the steps taken in creating a prototype system to support land use planning in Mexico with web-based geo-processing capabilities currently not present in commercial web-GIS products. We show that the process is straightforward and accessible to a broad audience of geographic information scientists and developers.

    abstract =  "As XML data becomes more and more prevalent and as larger quantities of data find their way into XML documents, the need for quality XML data organization will only increase. One standard way of structuring data well is to reduce and, if possible, eliminate redundancy, while at the same time making the storage structures as compact as possible. In this paper, we present a methodology to generate XML storage structures where conforming XML documents are redundancy-free, and for most practical cases, are also fully compact. Our methodology assumes the input is a conceptual-model hypergraph. For the special case that every edge in the hypergraph is binary, we present a simple algorithm, guaranteed to always generate redundancy-free storage structures. We show, however, that generating a minimum number of redundancy-free storage structures is NP-hard. We therefore provide heuristics to guide the process and observe that these heuristics result in satisfactory solutions, which are often optimal. We then present a general algorithm for n-ary edges and show that it generates redundancy-free storage structures. The general algorithm must overcome several problems that do not arise in the special case."

We then consider its potential impact on future intelligent transportation systems, including telematics and public transit systems. Many of us have already recognized how important a role the communications systems play in modern transportation.

Some researchers address this challenge by defining reusable components for specific learning tasks. The problems are that developers impose their particular solution, adapting components to requirement changes requires much effort, developers might lack the expertise to identify the appropriate group dynamics, and the resulting software might be used in unexpected ways. An approach based on an interaction model lets designers and educational experts specify the interactions in a learning activity. They can then define a set of reusable interaction components. The resulting flexible model is the basis for a flexible architecture that lets you create, extend, reuse, and compose diverse educational software products."

This review paper presents a list of the features which appear to distinguish these languages from those traditionally used to describe and develop database-intensive applications, and considers the motivation for these features as well as the potential advantages to be gained through their use. The paper, which is intended for those familiar with current data processing practices, also compares in greater detail four programming languages which incorporate semantic modeling facilities, and discusses some of the methodologies and tools for Information System development based on these languages."

A mapping is a set of rules and techniques for translating one model into another. When the starting and final models are expressed in the same formalism, the mapping is said to be intralanguage; otherwise, it is interlanguage. We focus here on interlanguage mapping, showing the central role of formalism extension mechanisms in managing the abstraction-level gap between languages as well as the platform-level details of specific implementations."

The purpose of this paper is to explain such patterns and rules in terms of WebML, a formal Web modeling language, for specifying the content structure of the Web application and the organization and presentation of such content in a hypertext. In particular, the paper shows that data-intensive Web sites can be abstracted as complex arrangements of elementary structures, called skeletons, which are pairs of structural diagrams (describing data organizations) and site view diagrams (describing navigational patterns). The essence of the proposed method is the classification of the role that concepts may play within the Web application information content, so that it can be abstracted and reduced to few, fundamental entities and relationships, organized according to an E/R diagram. Such a classification then feeds the identification of WebML skeletons."

    abstract =  "Web services are frequently described as the latest incarnation of distributed object technology. This misconception, perpetuated by people from both industry and academia, seriously limits broader acceptance of the true Web services architecture. Although the architects of many distributed and Internet systems have been vocal about the differences between Web services and distributed objects, dispelling the myth that they are closely related appears difficult. Many believe that Web services is a distributed systems technology that relies on some form of distributed object technology. Unfortunately, this is not the only common misconception about Web services. We seek to clarify several widely held beliefs about the technology that are partially or completely wrong. Within the distributed technology world, it is probably more appropriate to associate Web services with messaging technologies because they share a common architectural view, although they address different application types. Web services technology will have a dramatic enabling effect on worldwide interoperable distributed computing once everyone recognizes that Web services are about interoperable document-centric computing, not distributed objects."

However, XML technologies are built on top of inherent (and not always well-defined) information models, and this may cause problems because (1) the information models of some tools may not support the required "view" of XML, or (2) there is no appropriate data model to work with the information model in question. In this article, we approach this question from the systematic side, and describe the most prominent XML technologies with regard to their information and data models.}

Today, government bodies consider their own websites to be a higher priority than technical infrastructures that open up their data for others to use. We argue that this understanding is a mistake. It would be preferable for government to understand providing reusable data, rather than providing websites, as the core of its online publishing responsibility. Rather than struggling, as it currently does, to design sites that meet each end-user need, we argue that the executive branch should focus on creating a simple, reliable and publicly accessible infrastructure that exposes the underlying data. Private actors, either nonprofit or commercial, are better suited to deliver government information to citizens and can constantly create and reshape the tools individuals use to find and leverage public data. The best way to ensure that the government allows private parties to compete on equal terms in the provision of government data is to require that federal websites themselves use the same open systems for accessing the underlying data as they make available to the public at large."

The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, "contextual integrity," as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of "spheres of justice," developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.}

    abstract =  {This Essay challenges the view that privacy interests are protected primarily by law. Instead, I argue that much of society's privacy is protected implicitly by transaction costs. This renders a significant portion of societal privacy vulnerable when transaction-cost-reducing technologies become widely used. I first observe that society explicitly uses and implicitly relies upon transaction costs to regulate behavior in different substantive areas. I then explore how this transaction-cost-based regulation operates in the privacy realm. Based upon the understanding that society relies upon non-legal devices such as markets, norms, and structure to regulate human behavior, this Essay calls attention to a class of regulatory devices known as latent structural constraints and provides a positive account of their role in regulating privacy. Structural constraints are physical or technological barriers which regulate conduct; they can be either explicit or latent. An example of an explicit structural constraint is a fence which is designed to prevent entry onto real property, thereby effectively enforcing property rights. By contrast, latent structural constraints, are the secondary costs arising from the technological state of the world --- transaction costs --- which implicitly regulate conduct by making certain activities too difficult to engage in on a widespread basis. Society relies upon these latent structural constraints --- or transaction costs --- to reliably inhibit certain unwanted conduct in a way that is functionally comparable to its use of law. For example, society has frequently depended upon the search costs involved in aggregating and analyzing large amounts of information to effectively protect anonymity. We might think of some of these inhibited behaviors --- behaviors constrained by transaction costs --- as constituting implicit "structural rights." The regulatory aspect of latent structural constraints and transaction costs may be non-obvious to policymakers in most instances. This is because it is common to think of transaction costs as manifestations of inefficiency rather than as serving a functional role. A focus on structural rights --- rights protected solely by the presence of transaction costs --- becomes significant because such rights are vulnerable to sudden dissipation. Emerging technologies tend to lower transaction costs in the areas where they are employed. This lowering of transaction costs may have the unintended side effect of eliminating structural rights that were regulated by the presence of transaction costs. For example, the emergence of search and data aggregation technologies may have had the unintended side effect of permitting privacy intrusions that were previously impossible due to the regulatory role of previously existing transaction costs. This Essay describes a conceptual framework by which policymakers can explore this association between constrained behavior and latent structural constraints and suggests that they employ this conceptualization in order to identify non-obvious privacy interests which may be threatened by emerging technologies.}

    abstract =  "This essay considers the relationship between privacy and visibility in the networked information age. Visibility is an important determinant of harm to privacy, but a persistent tendency to conceptualize privacy harms and expectations in terms of visibility has created two problems. First, focusing on visibility diminishes the salience and obscures the operation of nonvisual mechanisms designed to render individual identity, behavior, and preferences transparent to third parties. The metaphoric mapping to visibility suggests that surveillance is simply passive observation, rather than the active production of categories, narratives, and, norms. Second, even a broader conception of privacy harms as a function of informational transparency is incomplete. Privacy has a spatial dimension as well as an informational dimension. The spatial dimension of the privacy interest, which I characterize as an interest in avoiding or selectively limiting exposure, concerns the structure of experienced space. It is not negated by the fact that people in public spaces expect to be visible to others present in those spaces, and it encompasses both the arrangement of physical spaces and the design of networked communications technologies. U.S. privacy law and theory currently do not recognize this interest at all. This essay argues that they should."

    abstract =  "Mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones are in widespread use already today and converging to mobile smart phones. They enable users to access a wide range of services and information without guidance through their actual demands. Especially during mass events like the Olympic Games 2008 in Beijing --- which was initially the context of our work --- a large service space is expected to support all mobile visitors, being athletes, journalists, or spectators. Current approaches tackling such problems are location based, meaning that a user's location is central to service provision, and even context-aware, meaning that, beyond location, characteristics of a user's environment are taken into account. Such information obviously helps to deliver relevant information at the right time to the mobile users. Going one step further, a situation-aware system abstracts from the context dimensions by translating specific contexts into logical situations. Knowing the situation end users are in allows the system to better identify the information to be delivered to them and to choose the appropriate services with regard to their scope, which is referred to as service roaming. Even though many context frameworks have been introduced in the past few years, what is usually missing is the notion of characteristic features of contexts that are invariant during certain time intervals. This paper presents these concepts in the context of a platform development, namely FLAME2008, which is able to support its mobile users with personalized situation-aware services in push and pull mode."

In this paper, we present a continuous query processor designed specifically for highly dynamic environments (e.g., location-aware environments). We implemented the proposed continuous query processor inside the PLACE server (Pervasive Location-Aware Computing Environments); a scalable location-aware database server developed at Purdue University. The PLACE server extends data streaming management systems to support location-aware environments. These environments are characterized by the wide variety of continuous spatio-temporal queries and the unbounded spatio-temporal streams. The proposed continuous query processor includes: (1) New incremental spatio-temporal operators to support a wide variety of continuous spatio-temporal queries, (2) Extended semantics of sliding window queries to deal with spatial sliding windows as well as temporal sliding windows, and (3) A shared-execution framework for scalable execution of a set of concurrent continuous spatio-temporal queries. Experimental evaluation shows promising performance of the continuous query processor of the PLACE server."

Hundreds of process and service composition models have been defined, thousands of papers have been written on the topic, and dozens of commercial workflow/service composition systems have been developed.

This technical report presents a complete and validated EBNF-based grammar for Wiki Creole, a community standard for wiki markup. Wiki Creole is also the only standard currently available. Wiki Creole is being specified using prose, leading to inconsistencies and ambiguities. Our grammar uncovered those ambiguities which we fed back into the specification process. The Wiki Creole grammar presented in this report makes the creation of Wiki Creole parsers simple using parser generators, ANTLR in our case. Using a precise specification of wiki markup lets us decouple wiki editors from wiki storage from further wiki processing tools. Based on this decoupling layer we expect innovation on these different parts to proceed independently and at a faster pace than before."

We study this question using two large inventories of Internet routers and links, collected by different methods and about two years apart. We first map each router to its geographical location using two different state-of-the-art tools. We then study the relationship between router location and population density; between geographic distance and link density; and between the size and geographic extent of ASes. Our findings are consistent across the two datasets and both mapping methods. First, as expected, router density per person varies widely over different economic regions; however, in economically homogeneous regions, router density shows a strong superlinear relationship to population density. Second, the probability that two routers are directly connected is strongly dependent on distance; our data is consistent with a model in which a majority (up to 75\%-95\%) of link formation is based on geographical distance (as in the Waxman (1988) topology generation method). Finally, we find that ASes show high variability in geographic size, which is correlated with other measures of AS size (degree and number of interfaces). Among small to medium ASes, ASes show wide variability in their geographic dispersal; however, all ASes exceeding a certain threshold in size are maximally dispersed geographically. These findings have many implications for the next generation of topology generators, which we envisage as producing router-level graphs annotated with attributes such as link latencies, AS identifiers, and geographical locations."

First, we study the formation of stable distributions in tagging systems, seen as an implicit form of "consensus" reached by the users of the system around the tags that best describe a resource. We show that final tag frequencies for most resources converge to power law distributions and we propose an empirical method to examine the dynamics of the convergence process, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The convergence analysis is performed for both the most utilized tags at the top of tag distributions and the so-called long tail. Second, we study the information structures that emerge from collaborative tagging, namely tag correlation (or folksonomy) graphs. We show how community-based network techniques can be used to extract simple tag vocabularies from the tag correlation graphs by partitioning them into subsets of related tags. Furthermore, we also show, for a specialized domain, that shared vocabularies produced by collaborative tagging are richer than the vocabularies which can be extracted from large-scale query logs provided by a major search engine. Although the empirical analysis presented in this article is based on a set of tagging data obtained from del.icio.us, the methods developed are general, and the conclusions should be applicable across other websites that employ tagging.}

We propose the adaptation of two baseline methods, inspired by well-known burst-analysis techniques, for the task; we also describe two novel methods, TagMaps and scale-structure identification. We evaluate the methods on a subset of Flickr data. We show that our scale-structure identification method outperforms existing techniques and that a hybrid approach generates further improvements (achieving 85\% precision at 81\% recall). The approach and methods described in this work can be used in other domains such as geo-annotated Web pages, where text terms can be extracted and associated with usage patterns."

This paper explores one important reality that surrounds the Internet today: different stakeholders that are part of the Internet milieu have interests that may be adverse to each other, and these parties each vie to favor their particular interests. We call this process "the tussle." Our position is that accommodating this tussle is crucial to the evolution of the network's technical architecture.

One of the goals of this project has been to re-use as much existing W3C technology as possible. We have reached it mostly by combining RDF with XPointer, XLink, and HTTP. We have also implemented an instance of our system using the Amaya editor/browser and a generic RDF database, accessible through an Apache HTTP server.

An ideal data extraction process can digest target Web databases that are visible only as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages, and create a local replica of those databases as a result. What is needed is more than a Web crawler and set of Web site wrappers. A comprehensive data extraction process must deal with such obstacles as session identifiers, HTML forms, client-side JavaScript, incompatible datasets and vocabularies, and missing and conflicting data. Proper data extraction also requires solid data validation and error recovery to handle data extraction failures. Our ANDES software framework helps solve these problems and provides a platform for building a production-quality Web data extraction process. Key aspects of ANDES are that it uses XML technologies for data extraction, including Extensible HTML and Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, and provides access to the "deep Web".}

It is shown that a schema is in DK/NF if and only if it has no insertion or deletion anomalies. Unlike previously defined normal forms, DK/NF is not defined in terms of traditional dependencies (functional, multivalued, or join). Instead, it is defined in terms of the more primitive concepts of domain and key, along with the general concept of a "constraint." We also consider how the definitions of traditional normal forms might be modified by taking into consideration, for the first time, the combinatorial consequences of bounded domain sizes. It is shown that after this modification, these traditional normal forms are all implied by DK/NF. In particular, if all domains are infinite, then these traditional normal forms are all implied by DK/NF.}

Furthermore, such problems are caused by certain functional dependencies among paths in the document. Our goal is to find away of converting an arbitrary DTD into a well-designed one, that avoids these problems. We first introduce the concept of a functional dependency for XML, and define its semantics via a relational representation of XML. We then define an XML normal form, XNF, that avoids update anomalies and redundancies. We study its properties, and show that XNF generalizes BCNF; we also discuss the relationship between XNF and normal forms for nested relations. Finally, we present a lossless algorithm for converting any DTD into one in XNF."

The many similarities between database-schema evolution and ontology evolution will allow us to build on the extensive research in schema evolution. However, there are also important differences between database schemas and ontologies. The differences stem from different usage paradigms, the presence of explicit semantics, and different knowledge models. A lot of problems that existed only in theory in database research come to the forefront as practical problems in ontology evolution. These differences have important implications for the development of ontology evolution frameworks: The traditional distinction between versioning and evolution is not applicable to ontologies. There are several dimensions along which compatibility between versions must be considered. The set of change operations for ontologies is difference. We must develop automatic techniques for finding similarities and differences between versions."

The structures of the ECR data model are defined, and a graphic representation technique for their display is presented. Language operations to define and use an ECR database are defined. Two realistic examples of the use of the ECR model for database design are demonstrated. The examples show how ECR structures can be directly mapped into relational and network structures. The definition of derived relationships on an ECR database gives the power to phrase higher order recursive queries in a first order query language."

The major activities on the business layer deal with user profiling and storyboarding, which addresses the design of an underlying application story. The core of such a story can be expressed by a directed multi-graph, in which the vertices represent scenes and the edges actions by the users including navigation. This leads to story algebras which can then be used to personalise the WIS to the needs of a user with a particular profile. The major activities on the conceptual layer address the support of scenes by modelling media types, which combine links to databases via extended views with the generation of navigation structures, operations supporting the activities in the storyboard, hierarchical presentations, and adaptivity to users, end-devices and channels."

    abstract =  "The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is fast emerging as the dominant standard for describing and interchanging data among various systems and databases on the Internet. It offers the Document Type Definition (DTD) as a formalism for defining the syntax and structure of XML documents. The XML Schema definition language, as a replacement for the DTD, provides more rich facilities for defining and constraining the content of XML documents. However, it does not concentrate on the semantics that underlies these documents, representing a logical data model rather than a conceptual model. To enable efficient business application development in large-scale electronic commerce environments, it is necessary to describe and model real-world data semantics and their complex interrelationships. In this article, we describe a design methodology for XML documents. The aim is to enforce XML conceptual modeling power and bridge the gap between software development and XML document structures. The proposed methodology is comprised of two design levels: the semantic level and the schema level. The first level is based on a semantic network, which provides semantic modeling of XML through four major components: a set of atomic and complex nodes, representing real-world objects; a set of directed edges, representing semantic relationships between the objects; a set of labels denoting different types of semantic relationships, including aggregation, generalization, association, and of-property relationships; and finally a set of constraints defined over nodes and edges to constrain semantic relationships and object domains. The other level of the proposed methodology is concerned with detailed XML schema design, including element/attribute declarations and simple/complex type definitions. The mapping between the two design levels is proposed to transform the XML semantic model into the XML Schema, based on which XML documents can be systematically created, managed, and validated."

The structure of these languages is formally described by schemas, for example using DTD or XML Schema, which allows individual documents to be validated. However, existing XSLT tools offer no static guarantees that, under the assumption that the input is valid relative to the input schema, the output of the transformation is valid relative to the output schema. We present a validation technique for XSLT based on the XML graph formalism introduced in the static analysis of JWIG Web services and XACT XML transformations. Being able to provide static guarantees, we can detect a large class of errors in an XSLT stylesheet at the time it is written instead of later when it has been deployed, and thereby provide benefits similar to those of static type checkers for modern programming languages. Our analysis takes a pragmatic approach that focuses its precision on the essential language features but still handles the entire XSLT language. We evaluate the analysis precision on a range of real stylesheets and demonstrate how it may be useful in practice."

Regular expression types, like most schema languages for XML, introduce regular expression notations such as repetition (*), alternation (|), etc., to describe XML documents. The novelty of our type system is a semantic presentation of subtyping, as inclusion between the sets of documents denoted by two types. We give several examples illustrating the usefulness of this form of subtyping in XML processing. The decision problem for the subtype relation reduces to the inclusion problem between tree automata, which is known to be EXPTIME-complete. To avoid this high complexity in typical cases, we develop a practical algorithm that, unlike classical algorithms based on determinization of tree automata, checks the inclusion relation by a top-down traversal of the original type expressions. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it can exploit the property that type expressions being compared often share portions of their representations. Our algorithm is a variant of Aiken and Murphy's set-inclusion constraint solver, to which are added several new implementation techniques, correctness proofs, and preliminary performance measurements on some small programs in the domain of typed XML processing."

Given the importance of object-oriented development techniques, one specific area where this has occurred is coupling measurement in object-oriented systems. However, despite a very interesting and rich body of work, there is little understanding of the motivation and empirical hypotheses behind many of these new measures. It is often difficult to determine how such measures relate to one another and for which application they can be used. As a consequence, it is very difficult for practitioners and researchers to obtain a clear picture of the state-of-the-art in order to select or define measures for object-oriented systems. This situation is addressed and clarified through several different activities. First, a standardized terminology and formalism for expressing measures is provided which ensures that all measures using it are expressed in a fully consistent and operational manner. Second, to provide a structured synthesis, a review of the existing frameworks and measures for coupling measurement in object-oriented systems takes place. Third, a unified framework, based on the issues discovered in the review, is provided and all existing measures are then classified according to this framework. This paper contributes to an increased understanding of the state-of-the-art: A mechanism is provided for comparing measures and their potential use, integrating existing measures which examine the same concepts in different ways, and facilitating more rigorous decision making regarding the definition of new measures and the selection of existing measures for a specific goal of measurement. In addition, our review of the state-of-the-art highlights that many measures are not defined in a fully operational form, and relatively few of them are based on explicit empirical models, as recommended by measurement theory."

The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this article we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture and used to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support."

We describe a continuum between weak and strong support of identity, and argue for the incorporation of the strong notion of identity at the conceptual level in languages for general purpose programming, database systems and their hybrids. We define a data model that can directly describe complex objects, and show that identity can easily be incorporated in it. Finally, we compare different implementation schemes for identity and argue that a surrogate-based implementation scheme is needed to support the strong notion of identity."

The programmer is then able to spend his effort in the right place; he concentrates on solving his problem, and the resulting program will be more reliable as a result. Clearly, this is a worthwhile goal. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for a designer to select in advance all the abstractions which the users of his language might need. If a language is to be used at all, it is likely to be used to solve problems which its designer did not envision, and for which the abstractions embedded in the language are not sufficient. This paper presents an approach which allows the set of built-in abstractions to be augmented when the need for a new data abstraction is discovered. This approach to the handling of abstraction is an outgrowth of work on designing a language for structured programming. Relevant aspects of this language are described, and examples of the use and definitions of abstractions are given."

Among sites providing indexing aids there was a clear under-representation of Asian sites. Nearly 80\% of the sites used Java, suggesting a reasonable level of technical sophistication among website creators. About one-third of the sites used cookies, raising the possibility that repeat visitors might find the navigation of the site customized to their needs. Overall an increase in the use of indexing aids, especially Meta tags, represents one way in which web robots could index sites more quickly and thus improve overall index coverage of the web.}

Despite its importance for policymaking and quality of life, attention is rarely paid to this vernacular geography because it is hard to capture and use. This paper presents tools for capturing this geography, an example of the tools' use to define 'High Crime' areas, and an initial discussion of the issues surrounding vernacular data. While the problems involved in analysing such data are not to be underestimated, such a system aims to pull together professional and popular geographical understanding, to the advantage of both."

With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations."

While much of the infrastructure for distributed data processing is already there (e.g., modern network technology), a number of issues make distributed data processing still a complex undertaking: (1) distributed systems can become very large, involving thousands of heterogeneous sites including PCs and mainframe server machines; (2) the state of a distributed system changes rapidly because the load of sites varies over time and new sites are added to the system; (3) legacy systems need to be integrated --- such legacy systems usually have not been designed for distributed data processing and now need to interact with other (modern) systems in a distributed environment. This paper presents the state of the art of query processing for distributed database and information systems. The paper presents the "textbook" architecture for distributed query processing and a series of techniques that are particularly useful for distributed database systems. These techniques include special join techniques, techniques to exploit intraquery parallelism, techniques to reduce communication costs, and techniques to exploit caching and replication of data. Furthermore, the paper discusses different kinds of distributed systems such as client-server, middleware (multitier), and heterogeneous database systems, and shows how query processing works in these systems.}

    abstract =  "Project Xanadu, the original hypertext project, is often misunderstood as an attempt to create the World Wide Web. It has always been much more ambitious, proposing an entire form of literature where links do not break as versions change; where documents may be closely compared side by side and closely annotated; where it is possible to see the origins of every quotation; and in which there is a valid copyright system --- a literary, legal and business arrangement --- for frictionless, non-negotiated quotation at any time and in any amount. The Web trivialized this original Xanadu model, vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking oneway links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use. Fonts and glitz, rather than content connective structure, prevail. Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations. Xanalogical literary structure is a unique symmetrical connective system for text (and other separable media elements), with two complementary forms of connection that achieve these functions --- survivable deep linkage (content links) and recognizable, visible re-use (transclusion). Both of these are easily implemented by a document model using content lists which reference stabilized media. This system of literary structure offers uniquely integrated methods for version management, side-by-side comparison and visualizable re-use, which lead to a radically beneficial and principled copyright system (endorsed in principle by the ACM). Though dauntingly far from the standards which have presently caught on, this design is still valid and may yet find a place in the evolving Internet universe."

It is widely recognized that achieving this semantic integration is very costly. Nearly all the published research concerns how system integrators can discover and exploit semantic knowledge in order to better share data among the systems they already have. This research is very important, but to make the greatest impact, we must go beyond after-the-fact semantic integration among existing systems, to actively guiding semantic choices in new ontologies and systems --- e.g., what concepts should be used as descriptive vocabularies for existing data, or as definitions for newly built systems. The goal is to ease data sharing for both new and old systems, to ensure that needed data is actually collected, and to maximize over time the business value of an enterprise's information systems."

To address this need, an experimental, open-source/open-content initiative, called the Connexions Project, was initiated. The Connexions Project offers an alternative to the way textbooks and other learning materials are created, maintained, and used. By design, Connexions greatly impacts current modes of teaching and learning, and the development and sharing of knowledge. In combination with powerful software tools which consist of an XML language, Connexions gives learner free access to educational materials that can be readily manipulated to suit their individual learning styles as they explore links among concepts. The free software tools also foster the development, manipulation, and continuous refinement of educational material by diverse communities of authors and instructor. An overview of the philosophy and progress of the project is presented, with a particular emphasis on its application to the area of signal processing."

This paper focuses on a model and the architecture of a system which supports group communications by providing group and session management functionality. The system architecture is related to DNS or X.500, however avoids their complexity by focusing on group and session management and adding functionality where necessary. New functionality is needed for the dynamics of group communications (members of a connection may change over the lifetime of the connection) and increased complexity of relations which may be established between objects. A model is described which defines six object types which represent the relevant objects. Users and groups represent real world users and their relations. Sessions and flows describe ongoing group communications. Flow templates and certificates provide mechanisms for management and security issues. The architecture presented in this paper can be used for group and session management support within different group communications platforms. A description of the implementation as well as implementation results are given in the last section."

As the Internet has moved from a research curiosity to a recognized component of mainstream society, new requirements have emerged that suggest new design principles, and perhaps suggest that we revisit some old ones. This paper explores one important reality that surrounds the Internet today: different stakeholders that are part of the Internet milieu have interests that may be adverse to each other, and these parties each vie to favor their particular interests. We call this process "the tussle". Our position is that accommodating this tussle is crucial to the evolution of the network's technical architecture. We discuss some examples of tussle, and offer some technical design principles that take it into account.}

The growing number of web services available within an organization and on the Web raises a new and challenging search problem: locating desired web services. Traditional keyword search is insufficient in this context: the specific types of queries users require are not captured, the very small text fragments in web services are unsuitable for keyword search, and the underlying structure and semantics of the web services are not exploited. We describe the algorithms underlying the Woogle search engine for web services. Woogle supports similarity search for web services, such as finding similar web-service operations and finding operations that compose with a given one. We describe novel techniques to support these types of searches, and an experimental study on a collection of over 1500 web-service operations that shows the high recall and precision of our algorithms."

We first describe this transformation and then assert that this will also affect enterprise architectures. Currently the state-of-the-art in enterprises around information composition is federation and other integration technologies. These scale well, and are well worth the upfront investment for enterprise class, long-lived applications. However, there are many information composition tasks that are not currently well served by these architectures. The needs of Situational Applications (i.e. applications that come together for solving some immediate business problems) are one such set of tasks. Augmenting structured data with unstructured information is another such task. Our hypothesis is that a new class of integration technologies will emerge to serve these tasks, and we call it an enterprise information mashup fabric. In the talk, we discuss the information management primitives that are needed for this fabric, the various options that exist for implementation, and pose several, currently unanswered, research questions."

These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1-2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a "one size fits all" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of "from scratch" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow's requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday's needs.}

    abstract =  "Although the presence of a schema enables many optimizations for operations on XML documents, recent studies have shown that many XML documents in practice either do not refer to a schema, or refer to a syntactically incorrect one. It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, we present a variant of this algorithm that works well on real-world (and therefore incomplete) data sets."

Since it represents a large portion of the structured data on the Web, accessing Deep-Web content has been a long-standing challenge for the database community. This paper describes a system for surfacing Deep-Web content, i.e., pre-computing submissions for each HTML form and adding the resulting HTML pages into a search engine index. The results of our surfacing have been incorporated into the Google search engine and today drive more than a thousand queries per second to Deep-Web content. Surfacing the Deep Web poses several challenges. First, our goal is to index the content behind many millions of HTML forms that span many languages and hundreds of domains. This necessitates an approach that is completely automatic, highly scalable, and very efficient. Second, a large number of forms have text inputs and require valid inputs values to be submitted. We present an algorithm for selecting input values for text search inputs that accept keywords and an algorithm for identifying inputs which accept only values of a specific type. Third, HTML forms often have more than one input and hence a naive strategy of enumerating the entire Cartesian product of all possible inputs can result in a very large number of URLs being generated. We present an algorithm that efficiently navigates the search space of possible input combinations to identify only those that generate URLs suitable for inclusion into our web search index. We present an extensive experimental evaluation validating the effectiveness of our algorithms."

We discuss the challenges involved in the design and implementation of a declarative and easy to use framework for discovering links between different data items in a single data source or across different data sources. We demonstrate different steps of the linkage requirements specification and discovery process in several real world scenarios and show how the LinQuer system can be used to create high-quality linked data sources."

Prior to 11g, text-centric XML documents can be stored as-is in a CLOB column and schema-based data-centric documents can be shredded and stored in object-relational (OR) tables mapped from their XML Schema. However, both storage formats have intrinsic limitations --- XML/CLOB has unacceptable query and update performance, and XML/OR requires XML schema. To tackle this problem, Oracle 11g introduces a native Binary XML storage format and a complete stack of data management operations. Binary XML was designed to address a wide range of real application problems encountered in XML data management --- schema flexibility, amenability to XML indexes, update performance, schema evolution, just to name a few. In this paper, we introduce the Binary XML storage format based on Oracle SecureFiles System. We propose a lightweight navigational index on top of the storage and an NFA-based navigational algorithm to provide efficient streaming processing. We further optimize query processing by exploiting XML structural and schema information that are collected in database dictionary. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate high performance of the native Binary XML in query processing, update, and space consumption."

In this paper, we propose to use the established and simple metamodel of feeds as a proxy for information resources on the Web, and to use feed-based methods for producing, aggregating, querying, and publishing information about resources on the Web. We propose an architecture that is flexible and scalable and uses well-established RESTful methods of loose coupling. By using such an architecture, mashups and the repurposing of Web services is encouraged, and the simplicity of the underlying metamodel places no undue restrictions on the possible application areas."

In a streaming context, the former is the largest class of XSDs where every element in a document can be typed when its opening tag is met. The main technical machinery consists of semantical characterizations of restrained competition grammars and their subclasses. In particular, they can be characterized in terms of the context of nodes, closure properties, allowed patterns and guarded DTDs. It is further shown that deciding whether a schema is restrained competition is tractable. Deciding whether a schema is equivalent to a restrained competition tree grammar, or one of its subclasses, is much more difficult: it is complete for EXPTIME. We show that our semantical characterizations allow for easy optimization and minimization algorithms. Finally, we relate the notion of one-pass preorder typing to the existing XML Schema standard."

With browsers, consumers can whimsically navigate among the various stages of a dialog and can thus confuse the most sophisticated corporate Web sites. In turn, Web services can fault in frustrating and inexplicable ways. The quickening transition from Web scripts to Web services lends these problems immediacy. To address this programming problem, we develop a foundational model of Web interactions and use it to formally describe two classes of errors. The model suggests techniques for detecting both classes of errors. For one class we present an incrementally checked record type system, which effectively eliminates these errors. For the other class, we introduce a dynamic safety check, which catches the mistakes relative to programmers' simple annotations."

One critical challenge is choosing the right combination of tools and technologies to do the integration. Although each has been studied separately, we lack a unified (and certainly, a unifying) understanding of these various approaches to integration. Experience with a variety of integration projects suggests that we need a broader framework, perhaps even a theory, which explicitly takes into account requirements on the result of the integration, and considers the entire end-to-end integration process."

Second, we investigate the behavior of Back. The typical stack-based behavior underlying Back is problematic because some previously seen pages are not reachable through it. To get around this problem, we offer several alternate behaviors of the Back button, all based upon a recency model. The advantage of recency is that all previously seen pages are now available via Back. Because trade-offs exist, we present both problems and prospects of these different Back behaviors in various navigational situations."

This paper presents a framework for semantically extensible schemas for Web Service evolution. The core idea of is to use declarative semantics to describe extensions to a service's vocabulary. These declarative semantics can be used by older software versions to understand the semantics of extensions, thus enabling older software to dynamically adapt to newer versions of the service. As long as declarative semantics are sufficient, older software can benefit from the service's extension."

    abstract =  {As the first step of most XML processing algorithms, one usually extracts token content out of the source document into many discrete string objects. We propose a "non-extractive" tokenization approach that maintains the source document intact in memory. Using a binary encoding specification called Virtual Token Descriptor (VTD), the processing model represents tokens exclusively using starting offset and length. To create a hierarchical view of the data encapsulated in the SOAP message, the parser further indexes elements of same depths using directory-like structures we call location cache. Through a demonstration of navigating the document hierarchy using VTD and location caches, we show that it is indeed possible to create a cursor-based API that retains most of DOM's random-access capabilities at a fraction of its memory usage. Furthermore, by analyzing key design constraints of custom hardware, we reason that the memory conserving characteristics of the processing model simultaneously make possible "SOAP on a chip" and "binary-enhanced SOAP." The benchmark results show that the reference implementation of our processing model significantly outperforms Xerces DOM in terms of both memory and processing performance.}

In this paper, we propose an XML-based markup format that addresses these problems and allows for semantic annotation of Web services of different technical flavors. This work is inspired by OWL-S, however it makes certain design decisions aimed to increase the ease of use of semantic Web service descriptions, by presenting a significantly more compact syntax for service markup and grounding. Furthermore, the proposed description format provides support for non-deterministic service operations."

Based on this approach, clients can subscribe to be notified when certain states in a business process are reached. Our goal is to design an architecture that brings REST's claims of loose coupling and good scalability to the area of BPM, and still allow process-driven composition and interaction between resources to be modeled."

This ontological structure is then exploited to help user formulate their queries. Subsequently, the ontologies are used to improve query routing across the Peer-to-Peer network. Finally, the ontologies are used to post-process the returned answers in order to do duplicate detection. The paper describes each of these ontology-based aspects of Bibster.

However, in many cases, like in medical applications, the ontologies may be very large and complex, and do not provide the end-user with intuitive facet hierarchies for conceptualizing the content, for formulating queries, and for classifying the search results. We argue that in such cases end-user facets should be separated from the annotation ontologies, and show how to generalize the semantic view-based search paradigm to take into account this fact. A user-centric card sorting method is proposed for designing intuitive views for the end-users and a method for mapping its facets onto the indexing ontologies and search items is presented. The system has been implemented in a prototype of the semantic portal TerveSuomi.fi, a national health promotion portal in Finland."

But without substantial Semantic Web content, few tools will be written to consume it; without many such tools, there is little appeal to publish Semantic Web content. To break this chicken-and-egg problem, thus enabling more flexible information access, we have created a web browser extension called Piggy Bank that lets users make use of Semantic Web content within Web content as users browse the Web. Wherever Semantic Web content is not available, Piggy Bank can invoke screenscrapers to re-structure information within web pages into Semantic Web format. Through the use of Semantic Web technologies, Piggy Bank provides direct, immediate benefits to users in their use of the existing Web. Thus, the existence of even just a few Semantic Web-enabled sites or a few scrapers already benefits users. Piggy Bank thereby offers an easy, incremental upgrade path to users without requiring a wholesale adoption of the Semantic Web's vision. To further improve this Semantic Web experience, we have created Semantic Bank, a web server application that lets Piggy Bank users share the Semantic Web information they have collected, enabling collaborative efforts to build sophisticated Semantic Web information repositories through simple, everyday's use of Piggy Bank."

In this paper we present an approach to automatically discover and create new Semantic Web Services. The idea behind this approach is to start with a set of known sources and the corresponding semantic descriptions and then discover similar sources, extract the source data, build semantic descriptions of the sources, and then turn them into Semantic Web Services. We implemented an end-to-end solution to this problem in a system called Deimos and evaluated the system across five different domains. The results demonstrate that the system can automatically discover, learn semantic descriptions, and build Semantic Web Services with only example sources and their descriptions as input."

A link discovery engine, which computes links between data sources based on a declarative specification of the conditions that entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked; 2. A tool for evaluating the generated data links in order to fine-tune the linking specification; 3. A protocol for maintaining data links between continuously changing data sources. The protocol allows data sources to exchange both linksets as well as detailed change information and enables continuous link recomputation. The interplay of all the components is demonstrated within a life science use case."

Due to the openness of this dataspace, it is not possible to know in advance all data sources that might be relevant for query answering. This openness poses a new challenge that is not addressed by traditional research on federated query processing. In this paper we present an approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data. The main idea of our approach is to discover data that might be relevant for answering a query during the query execution itself. This discovery is driven by following RDF links between data sources based on URIs in the query and in partial results. The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocol into RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset. This paper describes concepts and algorithms to implement our approach using an iterator-based pipeline. We introduce a formalization of the pipelining approach and show that classical iterators may cause blocking due to the latency of HTTP requests. To avoid blocking, we propose an extension of the iterator paradigm. The evaluation of our approach shows its strengths as well as the still existing challenges."

In the case of lightweight SWS approaches, such as SAWSDL, service description is achieved by semantically annotating existing web service interfaces. Other approaches such as OWL-S and WSMO describe services in a separate ontology. So, existing approaches separate service description from domain description, therefore increasing design efforts. We propose EXPRESS a lightweight approach to SWS that requires the domain ontology definition only. Its simplicity stems from the similarities between REST and the Semantic Web such as resource realization, self describing representations, and uniform interfaces. The semantics of a service is elicited from a resource's semantic description in the domain ontology and the semantics of the uniform interface, hence eliminating the need for ontologically describing services. We provide an example that illustrates EXPRESS and then discuss how it compares to SA-REST and WSMO."

The XML based messaging paradigm of RESTful services has made it possible to compose various services together. Such compositions of RESTful services is widely referred to as Mashups. In this paper, we outline the limitations in current approaches to creating mashups. We address these limitations by proposing a framework called as SA-REST. SA-REST adds semantics to RESTful services. Our proposed framework builds upon the original ideas in WSDL-S, our W3C submission, which was subsequently adapted for Semantic Annotation of WSDL (SAWSDL), now a W3C proposed recommendation. We demonstrate use of microformats for semantic annotation of RESTful services and then the use of such semantically enabled services with better support for interoperability for creating dynamic mashups called SMashups."

In this paper, we propose an approach of using provenance information about the data on the Web to assess their quality and trustworthiness. Our contributions include a model for Web data provenance and an assessment method that can be adapted for specific quality criteria. We demonstrate how this method can be used to evaluate the timeliness of data on the Web, to reflect how up-to-date the data is. We also propose a possible solution to deal with missing provenance information by associating certainty values with calculated quality values."

Such a Web of Wearables will make wearables as easily accessible as other Web resources, allowing new classes of applications and systems to use them. This Web of Wearables will establish an ecosystem noticeably different from the current Web with more ties to the real world, more ties to personal information and data, and more ways to interact with the real world. It remains to be seen which applications and systems will emerge, but the designs of today will have an impact on what is possible tomorrow, so we should strive to make sure that the ecosystem we design is open, extensible, and flexible."

However, in a world where applications increasingly draw on a wide variety of LBS providers as the back-end, and where more and more applications are using small-screen or even screenless devices, UI-centered views of designing security and privacy are no longer sufficient. In this position paper, we describe the increasingly varied landscape of platforms with which users are faced today, and argue that the most important level to look at is the service level, so that security and privacy issues are described and negotiated in a machine-readable way, and can thus be adapted to new platforms and UIs more easily. While matters of UI and User Experience (UX) are important, we argue that they should be derived from a service-oriented view, instead of being designed and built for each platform individually."

We believe that one of the greatest challenges we face in creating a new research paradigm will be building the community modeling and information sharing culture. How do we get engineers and scientists to put aside their traditional modes of doing business? How do we provide the incentives that will be required to make these changes happen? How do we get our colleagues to see that the benefits of sharing resources far outweigh the costs? We argue that timely sharing of data and information is not only in the best interest of the research community, but that it is also in the best interest of the scientist who is doing the sharing."

With the latest release of the Java Platform (the Java 2 Software Development Kit, v 1.2), fine-grained access controls can be placed upon critical resources with regard to the identity of the running applets and applications, which are distinguished by where the code came from and who signed it. However, the Java platform still lacks the means to enforce access controls based on the identity of the user who runs the code. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), a framework and programming interface that augments the Java platform with both user-based authentication and access control capabilities."

To enable a mashup to gather data from legacy applications and services, users must give the mashup their login names and passwords for those services. This all-or-nothing approach violates the principle of least privilege and leaves users vulnerable to misuse of their credentials by malicious mashups. In this paper, we introduce delegation permits --- a stateless approach to access rights delegation in mashups --- and describe our complete implementation of a permit-based authorization delegation service. Our protocol and implementation enable fine grained, flexible, and stateless access control and authorization for distributed delegated authorization in mashups, while minimizing attackers' ability to capture and exploit users' authentication credentials."

The distinct characteristic about LAWS is its high degree of modularity and flexibility. By embedding the location information in HTTP requests, we can add location to the system while using existing browsers and existing web servers. This way, there is also, to some degree, independence between the overall system and the positioning system. LAWS can be used in a number of different environments using different positioning systems, and serving different purposes."

We propose a model and a format for site metadata that is built on top of an existing format and thus could be deployed with little overhead by publishers as well as consumers. Making site metadata available as machine-readable data can be used for improving user interfaces (informing user agents about the context of the page they are displaying) and better information retrieval (allowing search engines to use sitemap information for better ranking and display of the results)."

Bibster exploits ontologies in data-storage, query formulation, query-routing and answer presentation: When bibliographic entries are made available for use in Bibster, they are structured and classified according to two different ontologies. This ontological structure is then exploited to help user formulate their queries. Subsequently, the ontologies are used to improve query routing across the Peer-to-Peer network. Finally, the ontologies are used to post-process the returned answers in order to do duplicate detection. The paper describes each of these ontology-based aspects of Bibster. Bibster is fully implemented on top of the JXTA platform, and is about to be rolled out for field testing."

The main areas of the survey have been questions about Open Government Data itself, questions about data, about the usage of data, questions about the requirements for a centralised data catalogue as well as questions about the participants themselves. The goal of the OGD Stakeholder Survey has been to reach a broad audience of the main stakeholders of open data: citizens, public administration, politics and industry. In the course of the survey that was open for 5 weeks from November 2010 to December 2010 in total 329 participants completed the survey. The results have been published in April 2011 in the form of HTML and PDF, the raw data in CSV. In addition to these publication formats (HTML, PDF, CSV) we published the data also as Linked Data using various vocabularies and tools."

One way to achieve this is in the form of communicating "rich" conceptual schemas. In this paper we adopt the well-known CM technique of ORM, which has a rich complement of business rule specification, and develop ORM-ML, an XML-based markup language for ORM. Clearly domain modeling of this kind will be closely related to work on so-called ontologies and we will briefly discuss the analogies and differences, introducing methodological patterns for designing distributed business models. Since ORM schemas are typically saved as graphical files, we designed a textual representation as a marked-up document in ORM-ML so we can save these ORM schemas in a more machine exchangeable way that suits networked environments. Moreover, we can now write style sheets to convert such schemas into another syntax, e.g. pseudo natural language, a given rule engine's language, first order logic.}

To model a database application in XML, we should first come up with a conceptual design for representing the application requirements, and then translate this conceptual design to XML. Existing conceptual models like the ER (Entity Relationship) model, UML and ORM do not have modeling capabilities to represent main features provided by XML, such as union types. In this work, we extend the ER model with additional features; we call our conceptual model as EReX (ER extended for XML). Translating an EReX design to XML enables us to make use of the different features provided by XML. Our approach further enables us to study a fundamental problem facing XML database community today: what structural and constraint specification should be provided in XML so that any generic database application can be modeled in XML."

    abstract =  {The emergence and popularity of XML helps facilitate the development and integration of business and application semantics. However, each enterprise defines their own data elements to better communicate the "meaning" of their data. Translation will therefore be key for interoperability. XSL standards for transformation are sufficient to allow exchange between business vocabularies. Currently there are many XSLT engine implementations. In this paper, we present a novel approach for implementing transformations using XSL. We describe a XSLT Virtual Machine (XSLTVM). XSLTVM is the software implementation of a "CPU" designed to run compiled XSLT code. A concept of virtual machine assumes a compiler compiling XSLT stylesheets to sequence of byte codes or machine instructions for the "XSLT CPU". This approach clearly separates compile-time from run-time computations and specifies an uniform way of data exchange between instructions by defining a common interface areas like stack or pipeline for example. The separation line between compile-time and run-time computations depends on the level of machine instructions. Splitting a heterogeneous, high-level instruction into number of atomic, low-level instructions exposes some run-time checks and allows compiler to take care of them. For example, a general CMP instruction checks operand types at run-time. If it is replaced with few type specific CMPs then compiler checks operand types at compile-time and generates appropriate type casting instructions if needed.}

    abstract =  {The family of upcoming XML technologies, consisting of XPath 2.0, XSLT 2.0, and XQuery, no longer operates only on the Infoset, but also utilize schema information. Today, this schema information is added to the Infoset during schema-validation and commonly is referred to as PSVI contributions (PSVI for "Post-Validation Schema Infoset"). Utilizing schema information is promising, for XML Schema allows to describe relationships between structures in an expressive, semantically relevant way, e.g. through type derivation and substitution groups. This structural information can become valuable metadata when processing instances that comply to the respective Schema. However, only a small fraction of this schema information is accessible with the aforementioned technologies. There are various reasons for this: Some schema information such as where wildcards can occur is not exposed at all, and other components (e.g. types) are only represented by QNames, lacking any possibilities to further navigate the schema information. Secondly, the PSVI specification remains vague with respect to the data model. And finally, the present data model of XML Schema is not appropriate for some application contexts. The existence of differing data models for XML Schema (e.g. in programming APIs for XML Schema) is evidence for the fact that the abstract data model as defined in the recommendation does not rule out the need for other data model perspectives. In fact, the abstract data model and its incarnations (namely the normative XML syntax) may be good for defining schemas, but it proves to be less appropriate for exploiting the structural information. Features that are convenient for definition (such as named groups and nested model groups) turn out to be problematic for retrieval and navigation, the most important ways of using the structural information. We propose an alternative data model perspective that represents the schema information in a way that meets the needs of certain classes of applications better. These applications have in common read-only access to schema information, an instance-driven perspective, the need for schema inspection at runtime, and possibly only a local scope. Our data model uses what we call "occurrences" instead of the "particles" in the normative abstract data model, and it expands what we (deliberately) consider to be notational shorthands (like occurrence constraints and named groups). Furthermore, we index all occurrences (even of the same element), as it is done in "marked expressions" in regular language theory. The structural information is not longer captured by model groups, but by a set of potential next occurrences. This is based on the idea of Brzozowski derivatives and again inspired by the anticipated needs of instance-oriented applications. We present a prototype implementation which is purely based on standard technologies. It is implemented as a XSLT 2.0 function library that reads schemas in the normative XML syntax, constructs the data model from this information, and provides various functions for accessing, navigating, and exploiting the schema information. We show that such functionality is highly beneficial, making applications more powerful, resilient, and easier to develop.}

    abstract =  "There are many benefits of using XML as the single data model for enterprise applications. In addition to its inherent flexibility and extensibility, it reduces impedance mismatch across tiers and provides opportunity for global dependency analysis and optimization. However, XML is fundamentally a tree data model whereas real world applications truly need graphs. The XML standards provide a few primitive ways of representing relationships (links) between XML nodes, namely ID/IDREF and XLink. But the existing standards require significant enhancements to be able to express declarative constraints (metadata) about links, to configure link behavior, and to easily query/traverse across forward and reverse links. This paper details the requirements and proposes a set of enhancements to XML schema and query languages to enable building enterprise and content management applications. Further, it describes various implementation issues and optimization challenges in managing links within large XML databases. Links between XML nodes can be either intra or inter-document links, and target a fragment (using XPointer) or the entire document. New schema annotations provide declarative mechanisms to constrain the type of the link target, scope the link to a specified domain and also express acyclic link conditions. The integrity of the link wrt to the guaranteed presence of target document and link validity when the target is renamed or moved can also be configured. New query functions enable forward and reverse traversal of links within XPath, XQuery and XSLT. We discuss efficient link storage techniques in XML databases and indexes for performant bidirectional link traversal. In addition to managing links that appear in the original documents, we present mechanisms to implicitly add links into documents. Since a document is the unit of locking, versioning and access control, there are several advantages to decomposing a large XML document into smaller sub documents. Users can declaratively express the decomposition rules using XPaths and/or XML schema annotations. When the document is inserted into the system, it is implicitly shredded into multiple documents, and XInclude link elements are inserted in place of the original fragments. These inter-document links can be managed, queried and traversed as described above. Users can also recompose the original document by invoking native XInclude expansion functions."

While there are many problems which are simply problems of certain technical decisions, other areas are more fundamental and lead to different perspectives and eventually implementations of service oriented systems. We argue that the current emphasis of service orientation as a collection of interface descriptions misses the critical point of services, which is that they revolve around resources. With a more resource-centered approach, the investment into a service oriented architecture can be made much more promising, because the resource-centered approach is better suited for the design of loosely coupled systems than the current interface-based approach.}

Tourists are expected to be important and demanding users of location-based services.

Mobile technologies will also allow tourists to be more discriminating in their patronage of different service offerings, especially as they gain greater knowledge of so-called "backstage" processes. These demanding needs will require choreography between services offered by many different commercial, cultural, educational, and community providers. The paper suggests approaches to deliver tourist location-based services based on low barrier of entry principles of web architecture.

In business we encounter this problem in data exchange: how do I map the messages and elements from my favorite B2B-vocabulary onto the B2B-vocabulary my trading partner uses? Ontologies try to define which things we speak (or exchange data) about and how we reference them. In mapping between two ontologies we often use equivalence relationships: 'LastName = given_name', 'Thomas Mann = der Zauberer' et cetera. In the first part of the paper I want to explore some philosophical notions on equivalence: the difference between intension and extension (Frege) and the idea that meanings aren't always precise (Wittgenstein). I will also discuss the relevance for IT of these notions. In the second part I want to explore some current solutions in XML and Knowledge Management: (1) The naive approach: Let's make a new vocabulary which covers everything, then let everybody use that vocabulary. (2) Adding meta-information: This approach is used in the Context Drivers of ebXML. (3) Published Subject Identifiers (PSI): Make public libraries of unique ID's for things and map to those ID's. In the third part I will identify some problems in the current solutions and propose an enhancement: we need to capture the knowledge in mappings and we need tools to help reusing this knowledge. An open and standardized format for storing and exchanging knowledge about mappings would be a major step towards ontology interoperability."

Nevertheless, the XSLT specification states: "XSLT is not intended as a completely general-purpose XML transformation language." It is surely even less appropriate as a general purpose programming language. Nevertheless, some XSLT advocates have noted that more and more processing can be moved into the XSLT domain as more and more data is represented or transferred as XML. On the other hand, scripting languages are certainly general purpose. Most of the modern ones have features designed for programming in the large such as object orientation and exception handling. They also have quite solid XML support. They could certainly be used to do anything that would otherwise be done by XSLT. Advocates of these languages also see more and more processing moving from the world of traditional programming languages (e.g. C, C++ and Java) into scripting languages. Some claim that there is no need for XSLT at all. They ask why scripting languages should cede any part of the XML processing domain to XSLT. Obviously these arguments can only be both compelling if there is some substantial overlap in the problem domains of scripting languages and XSLT. This paper is intended to explore this overlap and help the reader to choose whether to learn and use one or both of these emerging technologies.}

However the growth of the Web Service stack with respect to the addition of new layers and expansion of the resulting infrastructure has not been studied in comparison with well-established protocol suites like the ISO/OSI stack or the set of protocols constituting the Internet. Strictly speaking, industry's demand for functionality and services enhancing the basic Web Service protocols such as XML-RPC or SOAP, leads to the creation of a full-fledged layered protocol suite on-top of the existing ones. Nevertheless, the various standards, specifications, and ideas have neither been consolidated on a common terminological basis, nor been integrated in a single framework of reference. This observation also applies to the established trio of Web Service standards composing of SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. According to the specific usage patterns of these specifications, they are not operating on one layer as the well-known triangular relationship graph suggests, but instead they are connected by means of unidirectional usage dependencies. From this point of view, the message patterns (MP) defined by WSDL 2.0 offer services to layers organized on top of WSDL which rely on the service interfaces exposed by SOAP. More precisely, not the interface definition with WSDL but the accompanying MPs act as the transport layer of the service stack. Based on this and other criteria, SOAP can be categorized as the basic low-level layer of the Web Service infrastructure corresponding to the network-dependent layers of the classical protocol suites. Based on these facts, all of the various efforts relying on the seminal Web Service protocols can be categorized at the various levels layered above the transport layer. This is especially true for specifications dealing with the management of sessions and transactions which are layered directly above the MPs. Also, security standards like XML digital signatures and XML encryption fit well into this by classifying them as part of the presentation layer. Furthermore, within the Web Service environment quite analogous application layer mechanisms (e.g. firewalls for content filtering) emerge are commonly known for classical network operation. Taking this congruency of established protocol stacks and the Web Service's one step further the analogy may serve as a valuable framework for the comparison of different architectural styles in Web Service deployment. Taking the continuing debate weighing services based on representational state transfer (REST) against those based on RPC-style SOAP as an example, both approaches reveal themselves as heterogeneous protocols. Both ideas are not mutually exclusive nor conflicting at all. Both protocols can be made interoperable by the use of bridges or gateways arbitrating between the two parties. Our analysis shows that Web Services are a true but yet incomplete protocol suite deploying classical Internet protocols as basic services by the continued addition of supplemental specifications and standards."

The primary focus is on XPath rather than XSLT, partly because Saxon does relatively little optimization at the XSLT level (other than in the way pattern matching works). Recent releases of Saxon support XQuery 1.0 as well as XSLT 2.0. However, the XQuery processor is an in-memory processor, not a database query engine. Optimizing database queries is an entirely different art, because it relies so heavily on rearranging queries to exploit persistent indexes. An in-memory processor does not have this opportunity, because the only indexes available are those that are constructed transiently for the duration of a transformation or query. Saxon's processing can be divided into three phases: parsing, static analysis, and run-time execution. These are described in the three main sections of this paper."

XML Schemas are a big step in that direction. However, they only allow users to specify primitive constraints like data typing and data format. Currently, we can find two approaches that represent a complement to DTDs or XML Schemas --- XCSL and Schematron --- and allow us to specify constraints and to validate the instances of a family of documents against that set of rules. Both are implemented on top of XSL. Both use a kind of an XML envelope to hide XSL specification. XSLT pattern language is the core language of both systems. With all these resemblances it is easy to conclude that they are quite similar. However they differ in some fundamental concepts. These two constraint specification languages together with XML Schemas were hardly tested and benchmarked with an huge test suite. The most significant results will be discussed in this paper. We will try to answer questions like: Do they do the same job? Are there some kind of constraints that are easier to specify with one of them? Do you need different background to use the tools? Is it possible to use them in similar situations (the same DTD, the same XML instances)? May we use them to produce an equal result? How do XCSL and Schematron relate to XML Schemas? What is the intersection area of these three? What kind of constraints each one of these three is able to specify? What kind of constraints each one of these three can not specify? In this article, we will use that test suite and show, step-by-step, the way we handled several kinds of constraints in many different instances."

   abstract =   "The XML Infoset defines the data model of XML, and it is used by a number of other specifications, such as XML Schema, XPath, DOM, and SAX. Currently, the Infoset defines a fixed number of Information Items and their Properties, and the only widely accepted extension of the Infoset are the Post Schema Validation Infoset (PSVI) contributions of XML Schema. XML Schema demonstrates that extending the Infoset can be very useful, and the PSVI contributions of XML Schema are being used by XPath 2.0 to access type information in a document's Infoset. In this paper, we present an approach to making the Infoset generically extensible by using the well-known Namespace mechanism. Using Namespaces, it is possible to define sets of additional Information Items and Properties which are extending the core Infoset (or other Infoset extensions, defining a possibly multi-level hierarchy of Infoset extensions). Basically, a Namespace for an Infoset extension contains a number of Information Items, which may have any number of Properties. It is also possible to define an Infoset extension containing only Properties, extending the Information Items of other Infosets. Further elaborating on this method, many of the XML technologies currently using the Infoset could be extended to support the Infoset extensions by importing Infoset extension using the extension's Namespace name. To illustrate these concepts, we give an example by defining the XML Linking Language (XLink), the XML vocabulary for hyperlinking information, in terms of Infoset extensions. We show how the proposed ways of supporting Infoset extensions in XML technologies such as XPath, DOM, and CSS could pave the path to a better support (and hopefully faster adoption) of XLink than we see today. XLink serves as one example, but the proposed extensions and techniques are not limited to this particular technology. The content of this paper is work in progress, contributing to the ongoing debate on how to deal with different XML vocabularies and their usage in other XML technologies. We believe that making the Infoset extensible would provide a robust and flexible way of making the data model of XML-based data more versatile, and creating an accepted way of making the data available through standard interfaces such as DOM and XPath."

Many organizations are starting to store data in XML and using XML as an intermediate format for publication and use of these documents. Most database systems have support for storing data in XML or internally representing XML data for storage. However, XML does not have a suitable mechanism for intuitively creating a conceptual model for the data and cannot automatically or semi-automatically generate the schema for the actual data storage. The area of designing conceptual modeling techniques for XML is still not adequately explored in literature. In this paper we describe the XER (Extensible Entity-Relationship) model, a conceptual modeling approach that can describe XML document structures in a simple visual form reminiscent of the ER model, and has the capability to automatically generate XML document type definitions and schema from such structures."

    abstract =  {Many web applications collect and manipulate user input as XML documents, usually by receiving input through forms. It is natural to think of a schema for a document created by the form to be the specification for the application's user interface. This schema defines the structure and type information for the documents moving in and out of the application. Incoming documents may be treated differently by the application depending on whether they conform to a schema. Because W3C XML Schema is itself an XML vocabulary, XML Schema files can be transformed using XSLT into any number of target formats: HTML, XML, text, etc. Our goal was to transform XML Schemas into XForms user interfaces. By doing so we tie the user experience of the application directly to the application's data model. Changes in the data model are reflected in the user interface via a "push of a button", thus eliminating the need for tedious rewriting of presentation code. There have been other efforts to construct interfaces from XML Schemas, but most of those we found are limited by the types of schemas they could consume. For instance, many make assumptions that there will be no named global types, or neglect imported types and extension. To be truly generic, a schema processor should be able to identify and process types and elements from any imported schema. It should be able to recognize when a type is extending or restricting another type, and locate, in any namespace, the parent type to process its content model as well. A generic processor also must be able to handle different schema encoding styles, such as Venetian Blind or Garden of Eden. This paper will address some of the key design and implementation issues we addressed to create a generic XSD to XForms processor. We will then outline how the processor is being used today, and how it might be improved in the future.}

    abstract =  {The new schema language defined by the W3C, XML Schema, is used in a number of applications, such as Web Services and XQuery, and will probably be used by an increasing number of users in the near future. Currently, XML Schema's data model, the "XML Schema Components", can only be represented in the rather verbose XML syntax defined in the XML Schema specification itself. We propose an alternative non-XML syntax, which is (1) much more compact than the XML syntax, (2) defined by EBNF productions, (3) re-uses well-known syntactic concepts where appropriate, and (4) is easy to implement using standard parser-generating tools. Our approach is comparable to the approach of the RELAX NG schema language, which also supports two alternative syntaxes, an XML-based one, and a more compact non-XML one. We believe that XML Schema could be made easier to use by supporting a compact syntax. Currently, complex schemas are very hard to read due to the large amount of XML markup, and the various tools and GUIs that are on the market differ widely and in all cases support only a subset of the features of XML Schema. We believe that there should be a compact syntax, optimized for human users, which makes it easy to read and write XML Schemas, and which supports the full feature set of XML Schema. Obviously, a non-XML syntax makes it necessary to introduce new tools. However, generating parsers from EBNF productions is rather simple and well-supported by standard tools (such as yacc and JavaCC), and the other direction (i.e., generating non-XML syntax) can be implemented by using XML tools. Our XML Schema Compact Syntax (XSCS) is geared towards human users, by re-using language constructs known from other application areas, such as DTDs and programming languages, and making them available for XML Schema component representation. Examples for this re-use of syntactic constructs are DTD-style content models, number ranges ("[a,b]" or "(a,b]" as in standard mathematical notation), and qualifying attributes like "abstract" or "final" known from programming languages ("final abstract type { ... }"). We also believe that graphical representations of complex structures such as schemas are not always suitable because some people prefer textual representations, editing might be faster when using keyboard input instead of using click-and-point operations, and graphical representations (usually) hide some information. We fully integrate the processing of our syntax into the existing pipeline of XML-based tools by creating a parser that generates SAX events or DOM trees from the compact syntax documents. This way, we can use the existing XML Schema validation engines and XML Schema error checking facilities already implemented in validation engines like the Xerces parser. In addition, we have a serialization module to generate compact syntax documents from XML Schema DOM trees. Our overall goal is to improve XML Schema acceptance by providing a syntax that is easier to work with than the XML syntax, and tools to process this syntax.}

Normalization allows for compatibility between unfamiliar systems, which is necessary to fulfill scenarios that view the Web as a single, large application. Component systems within a Web application might benefit from relying on an early normalization process, which allows them to perform operations such as collation and string-matching without having to consider multiple potential forms of the incoming data. However, universal mandatory normalization can also restrict the flexibility for systems engaged in a private contract to efficiently use XML and XML-based technologies. Web services are probably the most prevalent example of such systems. The early normalization process might require a system to perform various additional encodings and decodings simply for the ability to use XML as a transport between system components, especially if they natively use a normalization form different from the mandated one. As current XML standards continue to evolve and new standards develop, the issue of mandatory normalization will continue to require the XML community to carefully consider the balance between two important Web scenarios: enabling unfamiliar systems to make certain assumptions about each other's data, without making it impractical for familiar systems to leverage the same standards and technologies. This paper will address these concerns by focusing on the specific issues around the character normalization debate."

This paper explores the benefits and gains made possible by processing documents marked up in XML syntax as definitions of sets and the relations between them. This change of understanding has implications for the relationship between data and metadata without necessitating either a new syntax or set of processing tools. The use of milestones or empty elements in XML documents has traditionally been advocated as a solution to the problem of multiple and potentially overlapping structures. One of the difficulties of processing milestones with tree-based tools is that it requires the extraction of a node (and element with child PCDATA) from a flat representation where the milestones are siblings of the PCDATA. This procedure is made more difficult by the presence of intervening elements and structures. A set-based understanding of markup syntax treats all elements as milestones, thereby 'flattening' the document and raising the PCDATA to the primary level. The virtual milestones function to mark the boundaries of a set."

    abstract =  "Many electronic publishing systems built on the top of XML (e.g. DocBook) use XSLT to convert source XML document into target formats like HTML or XSL-FO (for print output). During the transformation back-of-the-book index can be generated and populated by index entries spread over the document. Creating index basically means to sort and group index entries by their first letter. However this solutions is appropriate only for some languages, English included. For other Latin based languages like Czech, Hungarian or Spanish grouping method is more sophisticated and can't be expressed in the standard XSLT 1.0. The task is even more challenging if we want to get internationalized indexes in some general stylesheet package like DocBook XSL stylesheets. These stylesheets should support as many XSLT implementations as possible what disqualifies usage of vendor extensions. This paper will show you how support for non-English index generation was implemented in the DocBook XSL stylesheets, what problems were overcame and what functionality is missing in XSLT 1.0, but can be added using EXSLT extensions. To deal with grouping problems like different accented letters belonging to the same group, multi-letter sequences denoting one group etc. solution based on XSLT keys over user defined function is provided. This function uses external localization files to lookup values which drive index generation and grouping. Method presented up to this point is sufficient for indexes in HTML output. Print output brings new problems. As the transformation and formatting phases in the XSL are separated there is no direct support for merging duplicate page numbers in XSL-FO. Fortunately many FO engine vendors provide custom extensions to deal with this issue. Integration of these extensions into the DocBook XSL stylesheet will be presented. The article also includes evaluation of XSLT 2.0 features available for index generation and proposals for further improvement of indexing method that will be able to handle CJKV languages."

Unfortunately, most REST service description languages and design methodologies focus on other concerns instead. RESTful API Description Language (RADL) is an XML vocabulary for describing Hypermedia-driven RESTful APIs. The APIs it describes may use any media type, in XML, JSON, HTML, or any other format. The structure of a RADL description is based on media types, including the documents associated with a media type, links found in these documents, and the interfaces associated with these links. RADL can be used as a specification language or as run-time metadata to describe a service."

As web technology has evolved, an emphasis has been placed on providing ease of design for both visual content and functional services for users. Web Services however, concentrate on the view of systems inter-operating with other systems rather than that of actual human actors, yet the concepts for ease of design are highly related and desired. Firstly, this paper presents a model-based approach to the semantics of web service composition XML documents built upon formal verification, validation and simulation techniques, utilising scenario-based design and implementations built in service composition standards. Secondly, the work assigns the semantics of compositions through the use of Labelled Transition Systems (LTS) in the form of Finite State Processes (FSP). Thirdly, an environment is described forming a tool to assist in undertaking the approach."

As an XML-oriented data integration language, XQuery is a particularly simple, productive, and efficient way to do this task. In this presentation, I show a servlet that provides a REST interface to any XQuery that a developer places in a secure deployment directory on an application server, then demonstrate the development of data services by writing XQueries that access XML, relational, and flat file formats such as EDI to create complex XML and HTML results, then copying to the deployment directory. In this environment, each XQuery inherently defines a REST interface. I will develop queries by dragging and dropping from relational, XML, and EDI (or other flat file formats) into the text of an XQuery, using a standard XQuery GUI environment, then copy queries into a deployment directory, and invoke them using a web browser. The servlet will run under Apache Tomcat. XML data is queried directly using XQuery, with an implement that uses document projection and streaming so that large XML files can be handled efficiently. Relational data is queried by converting XQuery to efficient SQL, executing the SQL, and returning the results as XML. EDI and flat file formats are queried by converting them physically to XML and querying them using the same document projection and streaming techniques used for querying XML documents. The REST interface to a query consists of the name of the servlet and URI parameters that identify the name of the query and the query's external variables. A query may also use the variable $content, which is bound to the content of an HTTP request if present. Preparing queries dramatically improves performance. Each time a query is invoked by a client, the servlet does the following: (1) If this query has been prepared and is up-to-date, the prepared query is used. If the query has not been prepared, or a more recent version of the query exists in the deployment directory, the query is prepared. (2) All URI parameters are bound to the query as external variables. (3) The query is executed, and query results are returned to the client."

In the context of a system that provides semantic integration of heterogeneous XML sources, the same information at a semantic level may have different representations in XML. However, the syntax of an XML query depends on the structure of the specific XML source. Therefore, in order to obtain the same query result, one must write a specific query for each XML source. To deal with such problem, a much better solution is to state queries against a global conceptual schema and then translate them into an XML query against each specific data source. This paper presents CXPath (Conceptual XPath), a language for querying XML sources at the conceptual level, as well as a translation mechanism that converts a CXPath query to an XPath query against a specific XML source."

The adoption of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the standard for data representation and exchange has led to an increasing number of XML data sources, both native and non-native. Recent integration work has mainly focused on developing matching techniques to find equivalent elements and attributes among the different XML sources. In this paper, we introduce a semantic approach to resolve structural conflicts in the integration of XML schemas. We employ a data model called the ORA-SS (Object-Relationship-Attribute Model for Semi-Structured Data) to capture the implicit semantics in an XML schema. We present a comprehensive algorithm to integrate XML schemas. Compared to existing methods, our algorithm adopts an n-nary integration strategy that takes into account the data semantics, importance of a source, and how the majority of the sources model their data when resolving structural conflicts such as attribute/object class conflict and ancestor-descendant conflict. Further, redundant object classes and transitive relationship sets are removed to obtain a more concise integrated schema."

    abstract =  "The availability of large amounts of heterogeneous distributed web data necessitates the integration and querying of XML data from multiple XML sources for many reasons. For example, currently many government agencies in US such as IRS, INS, FBI, CIA are integrating their system to deal with new security threats, and these different departments uses legacy database systems including relational data, flat files, spreadsheets, and html pages, and simple text data. Similarly, there are many e-commerce companies, which sell similar products but represent data using different XML schemas. When any two such companies merge, or make an effort to service customers in cooperation, there is a need for a uniform schema integration methodology. In some applications like comparison-shopping, there is a need for an illusionary centralized homogeneous information system. Such systems need a uniform data representation and access platform, which is provided by XML. However, the XML schema and data are still heterogeneous and represent their constraints differently. To avoid the overhead of system integration and system specific data access mechanisms, applications should be provided with data in an integrated form. The idea is to use XML as an intermediate medium to achieve date integration from heterogeneous data resources. There are many efforts currently on generating views or representing data in only XML format, but internally stored in legacy databases. Using wrappers, applications can view the data in XML, instead of moving the data from their original format to XML. However, wrappers fail if the structure of the data is dynamically changed. Our approach is two phase; the integration of the local XML schemas into a global schema, and the integration of the resultant XML data produced in response to the queries to the local XML data sources. A global schema eliminates data model differences by integrating local schemas. The heterogeneous XML data sources need not be represented in an integrated fashion. This is because integrating the XML data and storing it in the new integrated schema occupies extra resources, and may result in duplication, and thus, creates the problems of multiple updates and data inconsistencies. For this reason, we present a dynamic mechanism, which can interface the different XML data and can present an integrated representation of the XML sources, rather than physically integration of data."

This paper focuses on the problem of automatically deriving Entity-Relationship Schemas (ERX Schemas) from DTDs (Document Type Definition). In fact, the derivation of such schemas from DTDs might be a hard work to do by hand, since real DTDs are very complex and large."

In addition, what are the most popular techniques and tools used for conceptual modelling? What are the major purposes for which conceptual modelling is used? The study found that the top six most frequently used modelling techniques and methods were ER diagramming, data flow diagramming, systems flowcharting, workflow modelling, RAD, and UML. However, the primary contribution of this study was the identification of the factors that uniquely influence the continued-use decision of analysts, viz., communication (using diagrams) to/from stakeholders, internal knowledge (lack of) of techniques, user expectations management, understanding models integration into the business, and tool/software deficiencies."

Because enterprises typically have many data sources using different assumptions, formats, and schemas, all expressed in --- or soon to be expressed in --- XML, it is easy to become lost in an avalanche of XML detail. This creates an opportunity for the conceptual modeling community to provide improved abstractions to help manage this detail. We present a vision for Conceptual XML (C-XML) that builds on the established work of the conceptual modeling community over the last several decades to bring improved modeling capabilities to XML-based development. Building on a framework such as C-XML will enable better management of enterprise-scale data and more rapid development of enterprise applications."

But few hypermedia systems have been implemented based on metamodelling principles familiar to the database community. Often there is no clear separation between conceptual and technical issues in the models and their implementations are not based on an explicit representation of a metamodel. This results in a loss of generality and uniformity across systems. Based on principles of metamodel-driven system development, we have implemented a platform that can support various categories of hypermedia systems through the generality and extensibility of the metamodel. We present our metamodel and show how it generalises concepts present in a range of hypermedia and link server systems."

Generalization/specialization and its constraints are fundamental concepts in system modeling and design, but are difficult to express and enforce with XML Schema. This mismatch leads to unnecessary complexity and uncertainty in XML-based models. In this paper we describe how to translate various aspects of generalization/specialization from a conceptual model into XML Schema. We also explore what needs to be added to XML Schema to handle the other aspects of this fundamental modeling construct. If XML Schema were to include our proposed constructs, it would be fully capable of faithfully representing generalization/specialization, thus reducing the complexity of the XML models that rely on generalization/specialization."

In most cases, the metamodeling view of XML-based application is rather simple, with XML documents being instances of some schema, which in turn is based on some schema language. In this paper, a metaschema layering approach for XML is presented, which is demonstrated in the context of various application scenarios. This approach is based on two generalizations of the standard XML schema language usage scenario: (1) it is assumed that one or more schema languages are acceptable as foundations for an XML scenario, but these schema languages should be customized by restricting, extending, or combining them; (2) for applications requiring application-specific schema languages, these schema languages can be implemented by reusing existing schema languages, thus introducing an additional metaschema layer. Metaschema layering can be used in a variety of application areas, and this paper shows some possible applications and mentions some more possibilities. XML is increasingly entering the modeling domain, since it is gradually moving from an exchange format for structured data into the applications as their inherent model. XML modeling still is in its infancy, and the metaschema layering approach presented in this paper is one contribution how to leverage the most important of XML feature's, which is the reuse of existing concepts and implementations."

In order to better focus on XML-oriented technologies in systems engineering and programming languages, an XML modeling language should be used, which is more focused on modeling and structure than typical XML schema languages.

An important objective of this translation is to preserve as much structural information from the conceptual schema as possible. This enables partial constraint checking by validating XML parsers and thus simplifies exchange of data between different databases, in particular the import of data in an XML document into another database schema. In detail we present translations of all constructs of an extended entity-relationship model to DTDs and integrate these into an algorithm. By basing the algorithm on conceptual schemas it is very general and may be customized for data in (object-)relational databases as well as data in databases of any other paradigm, e.g. native XML databases."

In fact, XML is emerging as the standard format for documents exchanged over the internet; then information systems will have to deal with XML documents, both incoming and outcoming. This is an exciting research area, because new technologies are arising, such as XSLT, but former and rather stable technologies, such as relational DBMSs, still have to play an important role. It is clear that novel information systems will integrate different technologies, but at the moment it is not clear how. This paper reports about our experience in developing the ERX Data Management System, a system devised to collect data coming from different XML data sources, and store them into a database in a way independent of the source format; its query language, named ERX-QL, is able to query the database and generate new XML documents. We developed the ERX Data Management System to explore the possibility of integrating three different basic technologies, Relational DBMS, Java and XSLT, under a unifying framework which makes the system interoperable w.r.t. the particular adopted technology (for example Relational vs Object-Oriented database technology); hence, this framework is based on an Entity-Relationship-like Data Model (ERX), which is not tied to any specific technical and/or commercial solution. The paper discusses the architecture of the ERX system, and the adopted technical solutions."

There is a growing number of applications that deal with XML documents in various respects. One area of programs is concerned with analyzing XML documents arriving, for example, over the internet. Another rapidly expanding area is best described by the term XML generators. XML generators usually are part of a WWW system, for example generators for XML documents serving as views of data bases. Although XML Schemas provide a concise means for describing the syntax of correct XML documents in a specific domain, XML generators usually treat the XML documents as unstructured strings or, in the context of the Document Object Model, as trees the nodes of which belong to an unspecific Element-interface. The syntactical correctness, i.e. the validity of the generated XML documents cannot be guaranteed at compile time but must be tested at runtime. This means that, in general, t here is no ultimate proof that an XML generator generates only valid documents according to an underlying XML schema. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a new distinct interface for each element defined within an XML schema. Each interface extends the Element-interface of the Document Object Model. This mechanism provides a generalization of a previous approach based on the weaker concept of Document Type Definitions presented by the authors."

    abstract =  "E-learning often is perceived as something that, on the technical level, can be addressed by designing an e-learning system, which often is equipped with a Web-based interface. We argue that this traditional approach of e-learning system design should be reversed in today's Web-oriented environment, in the sense that e-learning applications should be designed as well-behaving Web citizens and expose their services through nothing else but the Web's loose coupling principles. This article presents a system for Web-based presentations which follows this approach in publishing presentation material in a way that is as Web-friendly as possible. We show how such a system can be used as one building block in an e-learning infrastructure; replacing the traditional view of monolithic e-learning systems with an open and loosely coupled ecosystem of cooperating e-learning Web applications."

At the same time, the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is generally accepted as data description language for both web-based information systems and electronic data interchange between different organizations. Since database systems form the backbone of essentially any information system, the integration of XML and database systems is a must. Data model heterogeneity and schema heterogeneity, however, makes this a challenging task, for example when mapping XML documents to relational database systems (RDBS). This paper focuses on data model heterogeneity and provides an in-depth comparison of concepts available in RDBS and XML schema specification languages, comprising XML DTD and XML Schema. Such an analysis provides the basis for developing appropriate middleware bridging the gap between XML and RDBS."

    abstract =  "XML is rapidly becoming the standard method for sending information across the Internet. XML Schema, since its elevation to W3C Recommendation on the 2nd May 2001, is fast becoming the preferred means of describing structured XML data. However, until recently, there has been no effective means of graphically designing XML Schemas without exposing designers to low-level implementation issues. Bird, Goodchild and Halpin (2000) proposed a method to address this shortfall using the 'Object Role Modelling' conceptual language to generate XML Schemas. This paper seeks to build on this approach by defining a mapping between the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams and XML Schema using the traditional three level database design approach (ie. using conceptual, logical and physical design levels). In our approach, the conceptual level is represented using standard UML class notation, annotated with a few additional conceptual constraints, the logical level is represented in UML, using a set of UML stereotypes, and the XML Schema itself represents the physical level. The goal of this three level design methodology is to allow conceptual level UML class models to be automatically mapped into the logical level, while minimizing redundancy and maximizing connectivity."

Several approaches to build up a dependency and normal form theory for XML databases have been published, mainly concentrating on functional dependencies and keys. XML-like database structures can be modelled by rational trees using constructors for lists and disjoint unions. This involves restructuring rules on subattributes. The absence of redundancy can be characterised by the nested list normal form. If ordering is ignored, constructors for sets or multisets have to be employed. For these the theory can be extended using counter-free functional dependencies. Finally, for keys an important research question is which systems of subattributes permit Armstrong instances. While this gives just a glimpse of a starting promising theory, a research agenda for further research will be set up."

Several languages for the specification of interorganizational workflows have been already proposed, each of them having different origins and pursuing different goals for dealing with the unique characteristics of interorganizational workflows. This paper compares these proposals, trying to identify their strengths and shortcomings. As a pre-requisite, a framework of requirements is suggested which categorizes the major characteristics of specification languages for interorganizational workflows into different perspectives. For each of these perspectives, a set of functional requirements is proposed thereby emphasizing the difference to traditional intraorganizational workflows. On the basis of this framework, seven representative specification languages are surveyed and compared to each other."

The integration of location-annotated data with existing personal and public information and services creates opportunities for insightful new views on the world, and allows rich, personalized, and contextualized user experiences. One of the biggest constraints of current LBS is that most of them are essentially vertical services. These current designs makes it hard for users to integrate LBS from a variety of service providers, either to create intermediate value-added services such as social information sharing facilities, or to facilitate client-side aggregations and mashups across specific LBS providers. Our approach, the Tiled Feeds architecture, applies the well-established, standard Web service pattern of feeds, and extends it with query and location-based features. Using this approach, LBS on the Web can be exposed in a generalized and aggregation-friendly way. We believe this approach can be used to facilitate the creation of standardized, Web-friendly, horizontally integrated location-based services."

RSS is very simple, and so is mostly used as a web service. However there is no satisfactory search engine which works for RSS. The reason is that RSS is continuously modified, and the structure of general search engines is ineffective to collect information from RSS sources. In this paper, we discuss a web crawling algorithm, and propose a structure for an RSS crawler which is geared toward collecting and updating RSS in the Web 2.0 environment. The proposed method (1) uses visited domain name history to predict the location of the RSS of a new seed URL, and (2) updates RSS information adaptively, based on some update-checking heuristics. These approaches can serve as cornerstones for an efficient and effective RSS search engine."

This paper shows how our previous framework for integrating heterogeneous structured data sources can also be used for integrating XML data sources with each other and/or with other structured data sources. Our framework allows constructs from multiple modelling languages to co-exist within the same intermediate schema, and allows automatic translation of data, queries and updates between semantically equivalent or overlapping heterogenous schemas."

Many information providers have presented their databases on the web as semistructured data, while others are developing repositories for new applications. Designing a "good" semistructured database is important to prevent data redundancy and updating anomalies. In this paper, we propose a conceptual approach to design semistructured databases. A conceptual layer based on the Entity-Relationship model is used to remove redundancies at the semantic level. An algorithm to map an ER diagram involving composite attributes weak entity types, recursive, n-ary and ISA relationship sets, and aggregations to a semistructured schema graph (S3-Graph) is also given.}

However, despite the growing interest, several issues still need to be addressed to provide Web services with benefits similar to what traditional middleware brings to intra-organizational application integration. In this paper, we present a framework that supports the model-driven development of Web services. Specifically, we show how, starting from the external specifications of a Web service (e.g., interface and protocol specifications), we can support the generation of extensible service implementation templates as well as of complete (executable) service specifications, thereby considerably simplifying the service development work."

Our goal is to develop a universal information platform that can support collaboration in a range of application domains, the basic sharing unit being the document. Since not all user groups have the same conventions and not all tasks have the same requirements, this implies that it should be possible to customize the collaborative environment at the level of both communities and individual tasks. In this paper we present the consistency maintenance models underlying the synchronous and asynchronous modes of collaboration. We highlight the importance of choosing a general structured model of the document and particularly analyze the multi-mode collaboration for two main representative types of documents: textual and graphical."

With its expressive power, XML enables a great variety of applications relying on such structures. As the data schema, an XML schema is a means by which documents and objects can be structured. Our approach is to model XML schemata and thus classes of documents on the basis of UML (Unified Modeling Language). We consider UML to be the connecting link between software engineering and document design, i.e., it is possible to design object-oriented software together with the necessary XML structures. For this reason, we describe how to transform the static part of UML, i.e. class diagrams, into XML schemata. The major challenge for the transformation is to define a suitable mapping reflecting the semantics of a UML specification in an XML schema correctly. Because of XML's specific properties, we slightly extend UML in a UML compliant way. Additionally, the resulting XML schema profile supports the tuning of the transformation to XML schema. Our approach provides the stepping stone to bridge the gap between object-oriented software design and the development of XML data schemata."

We focus on efficient insert operations, support of streamed data and fast retrieval of document fragments. Therefore we introduce a new numbering scheme called DLN (Dynamic Level Numbering) and several variants of it. A performance evaluation based on a prototypical implementation demonstrates the high efficiency of DLN."

    abstract =  {The goal of automating information systems building was stated in the sixties. Forty years later it is clear that the goal has not been achieved in a satisfactory degree. One of the problems has been the lack of standards in languages and platforms. In this respect, the recent efforts on standardization provide an opportunity to revive the automation goal. This is the main purpose of this paper. We have named the goal "conceptual schema-centric development" (CSCD) in order to emphasize that the conceptual schema should be the center of the development of information systems. We show that to develop an information system it is necessary to define its conceptual schema and that, therefore, the CSCD approach does not place an extra burden on developers. In CSCD, conceptual schemas would be explicit, executable in the production environment and the basis for the system evolution. To achieve the CSCD goal it is necessary to solve many research problems. We identify and comment on a few problems that should be included in a research agenda for CSCD. Finally, we show that the CSCD goal can be qualified as a grand challenge for the information systems research community.}

For this purpose, a complete environment is presented based on conceptual modeling of user interfaces of information systems structured around three axes: the models that characterize a user interface from the end user's viewpoint and the specification language that allows designers to specify such interfaces, the method for developing interfaces in forward, reverse, and lateral engineering based on these models, and a suite of tools that support designers in applying the method based on the models. This environment is compatible with the Model-Driven Architecture recommendations in the sense that all models adhere to the principle of separation of concerns and are based on model transformation between the MDA levels. The models and the transformations of these models are all expressed in UsiXML (User Interface Extensible Markup Language) and maintained in a model repository that can be accessed by the suite of tools. Thanks to this environment, it is possible to quickly develop and deploy a wide array of user interfaces for different computing platforms, for different interaction modalities, for different markup and programming languages, and for various contexts of use."

XML-Schema, which is an emerging text-based schema definition language, promises to become the most popular method for describing these XML-documents. While text-based languages, such as XML-Schema, offer great advantages for data interchange on the Internet, graphical modelling languages are widely accepted as a more visually effective means of specifying and communicating data requirements for a human audience. With this in mind, this paper investigates the use of Object Role Modelling (ORM), a graphical, conceptual modelling technique, as a means for designing XML-Schemas. The primary benefit of using ORM is that it is much easier to get the model 'correct' by designing it in ORM first, rather than in XML. To facilitate this process we describe an algorithm that enables an XML-Schema file to be automatically generated from an ORM conceptual data model. Our approach aims to reduce data redundancy and increase the connectivity of the resulting XML instances."

In this paper, we attempt to make a systematic approach to data modeling capabilities of XML schemas. We first formalize a core set of features among a dozen competing XML schema language proposals and introduce a new notion of XGrammar. The benefits of such formal description is that it is both concise and precise. We then compare the features of XGrammar with those of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. We especially focus on three data modeling capabilities of XGrammar: (a) the ability to represent  ordered binary relationships, (b) the ability to represent a set of semantically equivalent but structurally different types as "one" type using the closure properties, and (c) the ability to represent  recursive relationships.}

This paper describes a  semi-automatic process for converting an XML DTD to a schema in a canonical conceptual model based on ORM/NIAM and extended ER models. This process is part of a bottom-up approach for integration of XML sources that takes a set of DTDs and generates an ontology for query purposes. A conceptual schema for a DTD simplifies the integration activity because provides a semantically rich representation of an XML source. The core of the process is a set of  conversion rules that consider the DTD structure and heuristics related to default semantic interpretations on such structure in order to generate the corresponding concepts in the canonical conceptual schema."

These are minimal conventions that can be followed by most and cover the most common knowledge representation cases. However, agreement and refinements are still required. We also show that a notation can be both readable and expressive by quickly presenting two notations --- Formalized English (FE) and Frame-CG (FCG) --- that we have derived from CG and Frame-Logics.

Our results indicate that YouTube is aggressively deploying cache servers of widely varying sizes at many different locations around the world with several of them located inside other ISPs to reduce cost and improve the end-user performance.

The permissions-based exclusivity likely to result from existing RELs and digital rights management (DRM) contrasts with the myriad limitations on exclusivity in the Copyright Act. Unless REL designers and DRM system implementers consider these limitations, DRM systems will alter the copyright balance in the direction of copyright holder exclusivity. In this paper we propose changes to RELs that would approximate the copyright balance more closely than current DRM technologies do."

    abstract =  "XML has become the standard format for representing structured and semi-structured data on the Web. To describe the structure and content of XML data, several XML schema languages have been proposed. Although being very useful for validating XML documents, an XML schema is not suitable for tasks requiring knowledge about the semantics of the represented data. For such tasks it is better to use a conceptual schema. This paper presents an extension of the Entity Relationship (ER) model, called X-Entity, for conceptual modeling of XML schemas. We also present the process of converting a schema, defined in the XML Schema language, to an X-Entity schema. The conversion process is based on a set of rules that consider element declarations and type definitions and generates the corresponding conceptual elements. Such representation provides a cleaner description for XML schemas by focusing only on semantically relevant concepts. The X-Entity model has been used in the context of a Web data integration system with the goal of providing a concise and semantic description for local schemas defined in XML Schema."

    abstract =  "The use of relational database management systems (RDBMSs) to store and query XML data has attracted considerable interest with a view to leveraging their powerful and reliable data management services. Due to the mismatch between the relational and XML data models, it is necessary to first shred and load the XML data into relational tables, and then translate XML queries over the original data into equivalent SQL queries over the mapped tables. Although there is a rich literature on XML-relational storage, none of the existing solutions addresses all the storage problems in a single framework. Works on mapping strategies often have little or no details about query translation, and proposals for query translation often target a specific mapping strategy. XML-storage solutions provided by RDBMS also have limitations. Notably, they are tied to a specific backend and use proprietary mapping languages, which not only may require a steep learning curve, but often are unable to express certain desirable mappings. In order to address these limitations, we developed ShreX, a XML-to-relational mapping framework and system that provides the first comprehensive and end-to-end solution to the relational storage of XML data. Mappings in ShreX are defined through annotations to an XML Schema. The use of XML Schema simplifies the mapping process, since it does not require users to master a new specialized mapping language. The use of annotations allows mapping choices to be combined in many different ways. As a result, ShreX not only supports all the mapping strategies proposed in the literature, but also new useful strategies that had not been considered previously. ShreX provides generic (and automatic) document shredding and query translation capabilities; and it is portable --- its mapping specifications are independent of the database backend."

On the one hand, native XML databases tailored to the semistructured data model have received considerable attention, and a wealth of index structures, join algorithms, tree encodings and query rewriting techniques for XML have been proposed. On the other hand, the question how to make XML fit the relational data model has been studied in great detail, giving rise to a multitude of storage schemes for XML in relational database systems (RDBSs). In this paper we examine how native XML indexing techniques can boost the retrieval of XML stored in an RDBS. We present the Relational CADG (RCADG), an adaptation of several native indexing approaches to the relational model, and show how it supports the evaluation of a clean formal language of conjunctive XML queries. Unlike relational storage schemes for XML, the RCADG largely preserves the underlying tree structure of the data in the RDBS, thus addressing several open problems known from the literature. Experiments show that the RCADG accelerates retrieval by up to two or even three orders of magnitude compared to both native and relational approaches."

Considering the size and diversity of the user community potentially involved in social tagging, this observation is rather surprising. Furthermore, we show by an evaluation using human-created relevance assessments the general suitability of the anchortext tag generation in terms of user-perceived precision values. The awareness of this easy-to-obtain source of tags could trigger the rise of new tagging portals pushed by this automatic bootstrapping process or be applied in already existing portals to increase the number of tags per page by merely looking at the anchortext which exists anyway."

Relational and object-relational database systems are a well understood technique for managing and querying such large sets of structured data. Using an object-relational data model and an XML datatype, we show how a relevant subset of XML documents and their implied structure can be mapped onto database structures. Besides straight-forward mappings, there are some XML structures that cannot be easily mapped onto database structures. These structures would sometimes result in large database schemas and sparsely populated databases. As a consequence, such XML document fragments should be mapped onto database attributes of type XML and kept as is. The XML datatype implementation should support evaluating path expressions and fulltext operations. We present an algorithm that finds a type of optimal mapping based on the XML Document Type Definition (DTD) and statistics. The statistics are derived from sample XML document sets and some knowledge about queries on XML document collections."

The tagging process is simple and fast, aimed to be applied to large collections of Web pages and to facilitate a variety of location-based applications and data analyses. Geotagging involves arbitrating two types of ambiguities: geo/non-geo and geo/geo. A geo/non-geo ambiguity occurs when a place name also has a non-geographic meaning, such as a person name (e.g., Berlin) or a common word (Turkey). Geo/geo ambiguity arises when distinct places have the same name, as in London, England vs. London, Ontario. An implementation of the tagger within the framework of the WebFountain data mining system is described, and evaluated on several corpora of real Web pages. Precision of up to 82\% on individual geotags is achieved. We also evaluate the relative contribution of various heuristics the tagger employs, and evaluate the focus-finding algorithm using a corpus pretagged with localities, showing that as many as 91\% of the foci reported are correct up to the country level."

We analyze two methods inspired by well-known burst-analysis techniques and one novel method: Scale-structure Identification. We evaluate the methods on a subset of Flickr data, and show that our Scale-structure Identification method outperforms the existing techniques. The approach and methods described in this work can be used in other domains such as geo-annotated web pages, where text terms can be extracted and associated with usage patterns."

In particular local search services have become a widely used mechanism to find businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, which satisfy a geographical restriction. Unfortunately, many useful types of geographic restrictions are currently not supported in these systems, including restrictions that specify the neighborhood in which the business should be located. As the boundaries of city neighborhoods are not readily available, automated techniques to construct representations of the spatial extent of neighborhoods are required to support this kind of restrictions. In this paper, we propose such a technique, using fuzzy footprints to cope with the inherent vagueness of most neighborhood boundaries, and we provide experimental results that demonstrate the potential of our technique in a local search setting."

Presently, a broader class of data base applications like office information systems is considered where this restriction is not convenient. Therefore, an extension of the relational model is proposed consisting of Non First Normal Form (NF$^2$) relations. The relational algebra is enriched mainly by so called nest and unnest operations which transform between NF$^2$ relations and the usual ones. We state some properties of these operations and some rules which occur in combination with the operations of the usual relational algebra. Since we propose to use the NF$^2$ model also for the internal data model these rules are important not only for theoretical reasons but also for a practical implementation."

These challenges arise in enterprise and government data management, digital libraries, "smart" homes and personal information management. We have proposed dataspaces as a data management abstraction for these diverse applications and DataSpace Support Platforms (DSSPs) as systems that should be built to provide the required services over dataspaces. Unlike data integration systems, DSSPs do not require full semantic integration of the sources in order to provide useful services. This paper lays out specific technical challenges to realizing DSSPs and ties them to existing work in our field. We focus on query answering in DSSPs, the DSSP's ability to introspect on its content, and the use of human attention to enhance the semantic relationships in a dataspace.}

The ROX impedance mismatch makes programs awkward to write and hard to maintain. The .NET Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) framework, proposed for the next release of the .NET framework, approaches this problem by defining a pattern of general-purpose standard query operators for traversal, filter, and projection. Based on this pattern, any .NET language can define special query comprehension syntax that is subsequently compiled into these standard operators (our code examples are in VB). Besides the general query operators, the LINQ framework also defines two domain specific APIs that work over XML (XLinq) and relational data (DLinq) respectively. The operators over XML use a lightweight and easy to use in-memory XML representation to provide XQuery-style expressiveness in the host programming language. The operators over relational data provide a simple OR mapping by leveraging remotable queries that are executed directly in the back-end relational store."

We assume that a distribution design of the document tree is given, providing an XML tree some of whose leaves are "docking points", to which XML subtrees can be attached. These subtrees may be provided and controlled by peers at remote locations, or may correspond to the result of function calls, e.g., Web services. If a global type t, e.g. a DTD, is specified for a distributed document T, it would be most desirable to be able to break this type into a collection of local types, called a local typing, such that the document satisfies t if and only if each peer (or function) satisfies its local type. In this paper we lay out the fundamentals of a theory of local typing and provide formal definitions of three main variants of locality: local typing, maximal local typing, and perfect typing, the latter being the most desirable. We study the following relevant decision problems: (i) given a typing for a design, determine whether it is local, maximal local, or perfect; (ii) given a design, establish whether a (maximal) local, or perfect typing does exist. For some of these problems we provide tight complexity bounds (polynomial space), while for the others we show exponential upper bounds. A main contribution is a polynomial-space algorithm for computing a perfect typing in this context, if it exists.}

Damia allows business users to quickly and easily create data mashups that combine data from desktop, web, and traditional IT sources into feeds that can be consumed by Ajax, and other types of web applications. This paper describes the key features and design of Damia's data integration engine, which has been packaged with Mashup Hub, an enterprise feed server currently available for download on IBM alphaWorks.

A lot of extensions and new layers have been built on top of it to allow e.g. DOM navigation and manipulation. However, JavaScript has become a victim of its own success and is used way beyond its possibilities, leading to increased code complexity. We suggest to reduce programming complexity by proposing XQuery as a client-side programming language. We wrote an extension for Microsoft Internet Explorer, based on the Zorba XQuery engine, which allows execution of XQuery scripts in the browser. An extension for Firefox is on the way as well. This paper demonstrates how client-side applications in XQuery look like and what they can do within a very small amount of code."

The framework is based on using information from a diverse collection of sources, each of which can be thought of as contributing one or more candidate link-titles for the URL. It can also incorporate the context in which the link-title will be used, along with constraints on its length. Our framework is applicable to several scenarios: obtaining succinct titles for displaying quicklinks, obtaining titles for URLs that lack a good title, constructing succinct sitemaps, etc. Extensive experiments show that our method is very effective, producing results that are at least 20\% better than non-trivial baselines."

    abstract =  "This paper proposes a new framework for organizing and accessing Web resources using loci defined on arbitrary Web documents. Our framework allows users to store Web resources in user-specified loci on a Web document to define a relation among them. This relation is retained as a set of tuples in a table called a Topica table. When users access such a locus, the resources associated with this locus are presented on the display screen. Each locus is associated with an attribute of the Topica table associated with this document. Our framework enables users to dynamically define such loci, called topoi, on arbitrary Web documents, and to input and/or output tuples of Web resources to and from a set of topoi defined on each of these Web documents. In addition, we propose a mechanism to access multiple related resources using a history of users' navigation through such documents."

RDF triples are a convenient abstraction for combining independently-generated factual statements, including statements about provenance. Harvesting is a strategy for asynchronously acquiring distributed information for the purposes of aggregation and analysis. Harvesting typically requires that information be temporally scoped and attributed to some creator or information source. An RDF triple asserts a fact without attributing it to any actor or period of time, so the abstraction must be extended to support typical harvesting scenarios. This paper compares standard, conventional, and non-standard means of extending RDF triples to associate them with attribution and timing information. Then, it considers the implications of these techniques for harvesting and presents some implementation sketches based on a journaling strategy."

However, determining the destination peer in the first place is not always trivial. We propose a model in which peers advertise their expertise in the Peer-to-Peer network. The knowledge about the expertise of other peers forms a semantic topology. Based on the semantic similarity between the subject of a query and the expertise of other peers, a peer can select appropriate peers to forward queries to, instead of broadcasting the query or sending it to a random set of peers. To calculate our semantic similarity measure we make the simplifying assumption that the peers share the same ontology. We evaluate the model in a bibliographic scenario, where peers share bibliographic descriptions of publications among each other. In simulation experiments we show how expertise based peer selection improves the performance of a Peer-to-Peer system with respect to precision, recall and the number of messages."

This system is an extension of directory services which are used with unicast communications. New functionality is needed for the dynamics of group communications (members of a connection may change over the lifetime of the connection) and increased complexity of relations. A model is described which defines six object types which represent the relevant objects. Users and groups represent real world users and their relations. Sessions and flows describe ongoing group communications. Flow templates and certificates provide mechanisms for management and security issues. The architecture presented in this paper is transport-independent, ie it can be used within different group communication platforms. A short sketch of the implementation is given in the last section."

To recognize events in the physical world, sensor data must be processed by non traditional way such as similar sequence retrievals. (3) fast signal stream persisting. All of sensor data should be stored to consider the reason of illegal events after accidents or offline data mining. To support the requirements, we propose a new database system KRAFT. To realize (1), KRAFT controls user-level threads on FreeBSD KSE scheduler. To realize (2), KRAFT provides similar sequence retrieval operators. The operators' distance functions are Euclidean and dynamic time warping. To realize (3), KRAFT provides direct persisting, which does not execute the write ahead logging process. We describe preliminary results of experiments and show the performance of KRAFT."

If the increasing number of available sensor-based data sources can be accessed in a simple and universal way, the network effect of aggregating, filtering, and republishing data from these sources will significantly increase their value. We propose an architecture where sensor-based data sources publish their data based on feeds, but extended with query capabilities. Using the well-known and widely supported Atom feed format and extending it with query capabilities allows us to lower the barrier-of-entry to sensor-based data sources, opening this data to a wider audience of clients."

These sensors are connected to a diverse set of systems and protocols driven by cost, power, bandwidth, and more. Despite this heterogeneous infrastructure, we need to be able to build applications that use that data, and the most value comes from integrating these disparate sources together. Infrastructure for the Internet of Things (including not just consumer products but sensors and actuators of all kinds) is becoming more commonplace, but we need an application layer to enable interoperability and create a Web of Things. Here we introduce a pragmatic, hypermedia approach to the Web of Things, integrating HTTP request/response interactions with realtime streaming using HTML5 WebSockets. We will discuss how our approach enables client/server interactions that are both evolvable by the server and discoverable by the client. Rather than attempt to define yet another competing standard, we incorporate a collection of complementary standards already in use. We will also describe our implementation of these concepts in ChainAPI, a sensor data server in use by a variety of projects within our research group. We will describe one of several end-to-end applications as a successful case study."

Radiolinja has more than 4000 messages from a multimedia messaging (MMS) pilot in summer 2002. In Radiolinja, it was found that 32\% of messages were a part of an interaction chain such as question-answer pairs, greetings, or stories. Thus, approximately 50\% of traffic in the network arose from interactional needs rather than from individual, unattached messages. After the practice phase, fluctuations in use are largely explained by interactional reasons. This paper suggests that user-generated content is a key element in the success of mobile multimedia."

In this paper, we present several important improvements and extensions of that work, including new XPath processing algorithms with improved time and space efficiency. Moreover, we define a very large and practically relevant fragment of XPath for which a further optimized form of query evaluation is possible. Apart from its immediate relevance for XPath query processing, our work also sheds new light at those features of XPath 1.0 which are most costly relative to their practical usefulness."

Since online information changes frequently, being able to quickly detect changes in XML documents is important to Internet query systems, search engines, and continuous query systems. Previous work in change detection on XML, or other hierarchically structured documents, used an ordered tree model, in which left-to-right order among siblings is important and it can affect the change result. This paper argues that an unordered model (only ancestor relationships are significant) is more suitable for most database applications. Using an unordered model, change detection is substantially harder than using the ordered model, but the change result that it generates is more accurate. This paper proposes X-Diff, an effective algorithm that integrates key XML structure characteristics with standard tree-to-tree correction techniques. The algorithm is analyzed and compared with XyDiff, a published XML diff algorithm. An experimental evaluation on both algorithms is provided."

Experimental results show that these algorithms are efficient in practice. We also investigate the complexity of propagating other XML constraints to relations, and the effect of increasing the power of the transformation language. Computing XML key propagation is a first step toward establishing a connection between XML data and its relational representation at the semantic level."

However, efficient traversal of huge Web graphs containing several hundred million vertices and a few billion edges is a challenging problem. An additional complication is the lack of a schema to describe the structure of Web graphs. As a result, naive graph representation schemes can significantly increase query execution time and limit the usefulness of Web repositories. We propose a novel representation for Web graphs, called an S-Node representation. We demonstrate that S-Node representations are highly space-efficient, enabling in-memory processing of very large Web graphs. In addition, we present detailed experiments that show that S-Node representations can significantly reduce query execution times when compared with other schemes for representing Web graphs."

This phrase refers to the fact that the traditional DBMS architecture (originally designed and optimized for business data processing) has been used to support many data-centric applications with widely varying characteristics and requirements. In this paper, we argue that this concept is no longer applicable to the database market, and that the commercial world will fracture into a collection of independent database engines, some of which may be unified by a common front-end parser. We use examples from the stream-processing market and the data-warehouse market to bolster our claims. We also briefly discuss other markets for which the traditional architecture is a poor fit and argue for a critical rethinking of the current factoring of systems services into products.}

We use COLR-Tree in a publicly-available sensor web portal to separate the concerns of sensor data management from the web portal application. COLR-Tree uses two techniques to optimize end-to-end latencies of users' queries by minimizing expensive data collection from sensors. First, it uses a novel technique to effectively cache aggregate results computed over sensor data with different expiry times. Second, it incorporates an efficient one-pass sampling algorithm with its range lookup to utilize cached data and compensate for occasional unavailability of sensors. We evaluate our implementation of COLR-Tree on SQL Server 2005 with a real, large workload from Windows Live Local. Our experiments demonstrate that COLR-Tree significantly improves both the end-to-end query performance and the number of sensors accessed compared to existing techniques."

These mechanisms include memory-isolated native code execution behind a narrow syscall interface, an abstraction layer that provides a consistent binary interface across operating systems, system services via hooks to existing browser mechanisms, and lightweight modifications to existing tool chains and code bases. We demonstrate a variety of applications and libraries from existing code bases, in several languages, produced with various tool chains, running in multiple browsers on multiple operating systems. With roughly two person-weeks of effort, we ported 3.3 million lines of code to Xax, including a PDF viewer, a Python interpreter, a speech synthesizer, and an OpenGL pipeline."

    abstract =  "The growing use of XML mark-up language has made a large amount of heterogeneous XML documents widely available. As the number of applications that utilize heterogeneous XML documents grows, the importance of XML documents transformations increases greatly. A serious obstacle for translating directly between two XML documents, using languages like XSLT, is that a mapping between the two XML representations needs to be carefully specified by a human expert. Current research attempts to address this problem by proposing algorithms to automate aspects of XML schemas matching task. In this paper, we identify two major problems encountered when current matching algorithms are used in the context of XML documents transformations. The first problem concerns possible scalability problem due to the diversity of schema constructs. The second problem deals with the need to perform semantic matching. We argue in favor of conceptual modelling as solution to avoid such problems. We introduce a new layered model for XML schemas, called Layered Interoperability Model for XML Schemas (LIMXS). LIMXS offers a semantic view for XML schemas through the specification of concepts and semantic relationships among them. We will show how our model transforms the matching algorithm into a dynamic and incremental algorithm that provide semantic mappings and helps to automate the transformation process."

    abstract =  "Today's Internet appliances feature user interface technologies almost unknown a few years ago: touch screens, styli, handwriting and voice recognition, speech synthesis, tiny screens, and more. This richness creates problems. First, different appliances use different languages: WML for cell phones; SpeechML, JSML, and VoxML for voice enabled devices such as phones; HTML and XUL for desktop computers, and so on. Thus, developers must maintain multiple source code families to deploy interfaces to one information system on multiple appliances. Second, user interfaces differ dramatically in complexity (e.g, PC versus cell phone interfaces). Thus, developers must also manage interface content. Third, developers risk writing appliance-specific interfaces for an appliance that might not be on the market tomorrow. A solution is to build interfaces with a single, universal language free of assumptions about appliances and interface technology. This paper introduces such a language, the User Interface Markup Language (UIML), an XML-compliant language. UIML insulates the interface designer from the peculiarities of different appliances through style sheets. A measure of the power of UIML is that it can replace hand-coding of Java AWT or Swing user interfaces."

If the document domain cannot guarantee referential integrity, but rather is more like the World Wide Web, in which documents change regularly and without notification, potentially invalidating internal location references, it is crucial to build robustness into the intra-document location resolution mechanism, so that locations continue to function even as documents change chaotically. This paper aims to begin a process to evolve a standard for (normative) robust location descriptors and (non-normative) reattachment algorithms. We discuss criteria for evaluating the robustness of an intra-document location mechanism. Then we describe robust locations, an approach we believe meets these criteria. Robust locations include a standard minimal location descriptor and a recommended reattachment algorithm. We also suggest what can be done when the changes are so great that location resolution is problematic. Finally, we describe the implementation of robust locations within the Multivalent Document system."

Current Web browsers make it hard to predict what will happen if a link is being followed: users get different information than they expect, a new window may be opened, a download starts, or the destination object is just not available. Instead of giving an appropriate notification in advance, users have to follow a link, check whether the document contains the expected information, get back, try another link etc. However, usually it is possible to obtain additional hyperlink information from several sources like link anchor tags, the user's history and web servers. Furthermore, with little enhancements, Web servers may include even more additional information to the hyperlinks in Web documents. These can be displayed before users select a link to improve navigation and reduce the cognitive overhead. In this paper several types of Web hyperlink information are listed, potential methods to present these facts are compared, the prototype implementation of the proposed concept --- called by us HyperScout --- is presented, and further developments are discussed."

To facilitate data exchange, industry groups define public document type definitions (DTDs) that specify the format of the XML data to be exchanged between their applications. In this paper, we address the problem of automating the conversion of relational data into XML. We describe SilkRoute, a general, dynamic, and efficient tool for viewing and querying relational data in XML. SilkRoute is general, because it can express mappings of relational data into XML that conforms to arbitrary DTDs. We call these mappings views. Applications express the data they need as an XML-QL query over the view. SilkRoute is dynamic, because it only materializes the fragment of an XML view needed by an application, and it is efficient, because it fully exploits the underlying RDBMs query engine whenever data items in an XML view need to be materialized."

It is a module for the Webvise open hypermedia system that implements the ideas of trails and guided tours, originating from the hypertext field. Webvise appears as an open hypermedia helper application to the user and stores the guided tours in an XML format called OHIF separated from the WWW documents included in the tour. The main advantages of the system are: (1) a browser independent format in terms of HTML and PNG-based image maps for reading the guided tours; (2) support for a familiar metaphor namely, a metro route map; (3) overview maps and route maps with indication of which stations of a tour have been visited; and finally (4) support for arbitrary web pages as stations on the tour. The paper discusses the Webvise Guided Tour System and illustrates its use in a digital library portal. The system is compared to other recent Web-based guided tour systems, and it is argued that Webvise Guided Tour System solves a number of prior system problems."

In particular, it is often unclear where a specific document is located. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to automatically find pages in a website whose location is different from where visitors expect to find them. The key insight is that visitors will backtrack if they do not find the information where they expect it: the point from where they backtrack is the expected location for the page. We present an algorithm for discovering such expected locations that can handle page caching by the browser. Expected locations with a significant number of hits are then presented to the website administrator. We also present algorithms for selecting expected locations (for adding navigation links) to optimize the benefit to the website or the visitor. We ran our algorithm on the Wharton business school website and found that even on this small website, there were many pages with expected locations different from their actual location."

    abstract =  "Search engines play a crucial role in the Web. Without search engines large parts of the Web becomes inaccessible for the majority of users. Search engines can make new and smaller sites accessible at low cost. Without them, other media, such as Television, would be needed to advertise the existence new site on the Web, only large commercial sites can follow this path. The Web would be endangered to become dominated by a few, well known sites. A crucial problem of search engines is to keep their index up-to-date. Especially if the index grows, the effort needed to update the index increases, since Web documents are dynamic and thus already stored data becomes obsolete. There have been various attempts to monitor the evolvement of the Web. However, we believe, that change model used in prior work over-estimates the rate of change due to an inadequate change model. Our change model has been adapted from the information retrieval field to distinguish index relevant changes from irrelevant modifications in Web documents, e.g. simple spelling corrections or dynamic advertisement links. We have monitored multiple smaller collections of documents over a time period of six month to measure the documents change."

XL provides high-level and declarative constructs for actions which are typically carried out in the implementation of a Web service; e.g., logging, error handling, retry of actions, workload management, events, etc. Issues such as performance tuning (e.g., caching, horizontal partitioning, etc.) should be carried out automatically by an implementation of the language. This way, the productivity of the programmers, the ability of evolution of the programs, and the chances to achieve good performance are substantially enhanced."

As a particularity of our framework, CREAM allows to create relational metadata, i.e. metadata that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively rigid template-like schema as Dublin Core. We discuss some of the requirements one has to meet when developing such an ontology-based framework, e.g. the integration of a metadata crawler, inference services, document management and a meta-ontology, and describe its implementation, viz. Ont-O-Mat, a component-based, ontology-driven Web page authoring and annotation tool."

    abstract =  "We present an algorithm for translating XSLT programs into SQL. Our context is that of virtual XML publishing, in which a single XML view is defined from a relational database, and subsequently queried with XSLT programs. Each XSLT program is translated into a single SQL query and run entirely in the database engine. Our translation works for a large fragment of XSLT, which we define, that includes descendant/ancestor axis, recursive templates, modes, parameters, and aggregates. We put considerable effort in generating correct and efficient SQL queries and describe several optimization techniques to achieve this efficiency. We have tested our system on all 22 SQL queries of the TPC-H database benchmark which we represented in XSLT and then translated back to SQL using our translator."

    abstract =  {In the original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results, a single PageRank vector is computed, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative "importance" of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.}

    abstract =  "Ontologies play a prominent role on the Semantic Web. They make possible the widespread publication of machine understandable data, opening myriad opportunities for automated information processing. However, because of the Semantic Web's distributed nature, data on it will inevitably come from many different ontologies. Information processing across ontologies is not possible without knowing the semantic mappings between their elements. Manually finding such mappings is tedious, error-prone, and clearly not possible at the Web scale. Hence, the development of tools to assist in the ontology mapping process is crucial to the success of the Semantic Web. We describe GLUE, a system that employs machine learning techniques to find such mappings. Given two ontologies, for each concept in one ontology GLUE finds the most similar concept in the other ontology. We give well-founded probabilistic definitions to several practical similarity measures, and show that GLUE can work with all of them. This is in contrast to most existing approaches, which deal with a single similarity measure. Another key feature of GLUE is that it uses multiple learning strategies, each of which exploits a different type of information either in the data instances or in the taxonomic structure of the ontologies. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend GLUE to incorporate commonsense knowledge and domain constraints into the matching process. For this purpose, we show that relaxation labeling, a well-known constraint optimization technique used in computer vision and other fields, can be adapted to work efficiently in our context. Our approach is thus distinguished in that it works with a variety of well-defined similarity notions and that it efficiently incorporates multiple types of knowledge. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that GLUE proposes highly accurate semantic mappings."

We engaged with users in task analysis as well as iterative design reviews in order to understand the interaction issues that are part of within-Web-page collection making and to design an interaction that would support that process. We report here on that design development, as well as on the evaluations of the tool that evolved from that process, and the future work stemming from these results, in which our critical question is: what happens to users' perceptions of web-based resources and their web-based information management practices when they can treat this information as harvestable, recontextualizable data, rather than as fixed pages?"

The SmartView interface enforces the concept of a document by allowing the user to view both the document overview (e.g., a zoomed out version of the document, a document thumbnail(s), etc.) and a detailed view of the selected section of the document. The layout of the detailed view is modified to achieve the presentation that is desired by the user or is optimal for a device. The SmartView functionality is essential in cases when the document layout is optimized for displays of certain size but need to be viewed on smaller devices --- a situation that requires significant document scaling and layout changes (e.g., viewing of Web pages on PDAs). It is equally important in instances when only a portion of a document needs to be displayed (e.g., showing a section of a Web page on a large screen). The current implementation of SmartView is compatible with the Microsoft Internet Explorer v.6.0."

We assume that large amounts of data exist that have been organized and annotated according to local schemas. Seeing semantics as a form of agreement, our approach enables the participating data sources to incrementally develop global agreement in an evolutionary and completely decentralized process that solely relies on pair-wise, local interactions: Participants provide translations between schemas they are interested in and can learn about other translations by routing queries (gossiping). To support the participants in assessing the semantic quality of the achieved agreements we develop a formal framework that takes into account both syntactic and semantic criteria. The assessment process is incremental and the quality ratings are adjusted along with the operation of the system. Ultimately, this process results in global agreement, i.e., the semantics that all participants understand. We discuss strategies to efficiently find translations and provide results from a case study to justify our claims. Our approach applies to any system which provides a communication infrastructure (existing websites or databases, decentralized systems, P2P systems) and offers the opportunity to study semantic interoperability as a global phenomenon in a network of information sharing parties."

    abstract =  "Traditionally, when one wants to learn about a particular topic, one reads a book or a survey paper. With the rapid expansion of the Web, learning in-depth knowledge about a topic from the Web is becoming increasingly important and popular. This is also due to the Web's convenience and its richness of information. In many cases, learning from the Web may even be essential because in our fast changing world, emerging topics appear constantly and rapidly. There is often not enough time for someone to write a book on such topics. To learn such emerging topics, one can resort to research papers. However, research papers are often hard to understand by non-researchers, and few research papers cover every aspect of the topic. In contrast, many Web pages often contain intuitive descriptions of the topic. To find such Web pages, one typically uses a search engine. However, current search techniques are not designed for in-depth learning. Top ranking pages from a search engine may not contain any description of the topic. Even if they do, the description is usually incomplete since it is unlikely that the owner of the page has good knowledge of every aspect of the topic. In this paper, we attempt a novel and challenging task, mining topic-specific knowledge on the Web. Our goal is to help people learn in-depth knowledge of a topic systematically on the Web. The proposed techniques first identify those sub-topics or salient concepts of the topic, and then find and organize those informative pages, containing definitions and descriptions of the topic and sub-topics, just like those in a book. Experimental results using 28 topics show that the proposed techniques are highly effective."

Extraction of "useful and relevant" content from web pages has many applications, including cell phone and PDA browsing, speech rendering for the visually impaired, and text summarization. Most approaches to removing clutter or making content more readable involve changing font size or removing HTML and data components such as images, which takes away from a webpage's inherent look and feel. Unlike "Content Reformatting", which aims to reproduce the entire webpage in a more convenient form, our solution directly addresses "Content Extraction". We have developed a framework that employs easily extensible set of techniques that incorporate advantages of previous work on content extraction. Our key insight is to work with the DOM trees, rather than with raw HTML markup. We have implemented our approach in a publicly available Web proxy to extract content from HTML web pages.}

However, this synchronized collection is not immediately searchable, because the keyword index is rebuilt from scratch less frequently than the collection can be refreshed. An inverted index is usually used to index documents crawled from the web. Complete index rebuild at high frequency is expensive. Previous work on incremental inverted index updates have been restricted to adding and removing documents. Updating the inverted index for previously indexed documents that have changed has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to update the inverted index for previously indexed documents whose contents have changed. Our method uses the idea of landmarks together with the diff algorithm to significantly reduce the number of postings in the inverted index that need to be updated. Our experiments verify that our landmark-diff method results in significant savings in the number of update operations on the inverted index."

Xspect handles transformation between an open hypermedia format (OHIF) and XLink, and the paper discusses this isomorphic transformation and generalises it to include another open hypermedia format, FOHM. The Xspect system, based on XSLT and Javascript, provides users with an interface to browse and merge linkbases. Xspect supports navigational hypermedia in the form of links inserted on the fly into Web pages, as well as guided tours presented as SVG. Xspect has two implementations: one server-side and one running on the client. Both implementation provide the user with an interface for the creation of annotations. The main result of the paper is a critique of XLink. XLink is shown to be a format well suited for navigational hypermedia, but lacking in more advanced constructs. More problematic are the issues regarding large-scale use, such as evaluating validity and credibility of linkbases, and ensuring general support for a format as flexible as XLink."

The first user study compares different highlighting techniques for link markers and evaluates their effect on reading performance and user acceptance. The second study examines links-on-demand, links that appear when pressing a dedicated key, and discusses their possible effects on reading and browsing habits. The findings of the conducted studies imply that the standard appearance of link markers has seriously underestimated effects on the usability of Web pages. They can significantly reduce the readability of the text, and alternatives should be carefully considered for the design of future Web browsers."

    abstract =  {The celebrated PageRank algorithm has proved to be a very effective paradigm for ranking results of web search algorithms. In this paper we refine this basic paradigm to take into account several evolving prominent features of the web, and propose several algorithmic innovations. First, we analyze features of the rapidly growing "frontier" of the web, namely the part of the web that crawlers are unable to cover for one reason or another. We analyze the effect of these pages and find it to be significant. We suggest ways to improve the quality of ranking by modeling the growing presence of "link rot" on the web as more sites and pages fall out of maintenance. Finally we suggest new methods of ranking that are motivated by the hierarchical structure of the web, are more efficient than PageRank, and may be more resistant to direct manipulation.}

    abstract =  "In the past few years, a number of constraint languages for XML documents has been proposed. They are cumulatively called schema languages or validation languages and they comprise, among others, DTD, XML Schema, RELAX NG, Schematron, DSD, xlinkit. One major point of discrimination among schema languages is the support of co-constraints, or co-occurrence constraints, e.g., requiring that attribute A is present if and only if attribute B is (or is not) present in the same element. Although there is no way in XML Schema to express these requirements, they are in fact frequently used in many XML document types, usually only expressed in plain human-readable text, and validated by means of special code modules by the relevant applications. In this paper we propose SchemaPath, a light extension of XML Schema to handle conditional constraints on XML documents. Two new constructs have been added to XML Schema: conditions --- based on XPath patterns --- on type assignments for elements and attributes; and a new simple type, xsd:error, for the direct expression of negative constraints (e.g. it is prohibited for attribute A to be present if attribute B is also present). A proof-of-concept implementation is provided. A Web interface is publicly accessible for experiments and assessments of the real expressiveness of the proposed extension."

In this paper, we present a domain-oriented approach to Web data extraction and discuss its application to automatically extracting news from Web sites. Our approach is based on a highly efficient tree structure analysis that produces very effective results. We have tested our approach with several important Brazilian on-line news sites and achieved very precise results, correctly extracting 87.71\% of the news in a set of 4088 pages distributed among 35 different sites."

Ironically, almost all template engines allow violation of this separation principle, which is the very impetus for HTML template engine development. This situation is due mostly to a lack of formal definition of separation and fear that enforcing separation emasculates a template's power. I show that not only is strict separation a worthy design principle, but that we can enforce separation while providing a potent template engine. I demonstrate my StringTemplate engine, used to build jGuru.com and other commercial sites, at work solving some nontrivial generational tasks.My goal is to formalize the study of template engines, thus, providing a common nomenclature, a means of classifying template generational power, and a way to leverage interesting results from formal language theory. I classify three types of restricted templates analogous to Chomsky's type 1..3 grammar classes and formally define separation including the rules that embody separation.Because this paper provides a clear definition of model-view separation, template engine designers may no longer blindly claim enforcement of separation. Moreover, given theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, programmers no longer have an excuse to entangle model and view."

Thus, XML is used to handle the data while its XSLT stylesheet is used to extract and format the data for presentation. However, different stylesheets have to be used for different devices. An efficient and systematic method based on the idea of generating two separate sets of rules corresponding to content extracting and formatting parts of the stylesheet is described in this paper. The data extraction part is constructed from content rules while the formatting part is constructed from presentation rules. They are then combined together to form a stylesheet by an XSLT generator. A large number of stylesheets corresponding to different devices and a number of standard DTD documents or XML schemas can be generated in this way and stored in the pool during application setup stage. They will be individually selected from the pool by an XSLT engine to produce different WML documents for different devices during run time."

Graphs are trusted depending on: their content; information about the graph; and the task the user is performing.

These proposals range from runtime API-based interfaces to XML-based programming languages. The subject of this paper is XJ, a research language that proposes novel mechanisms for the integration of XML as a first-class construct into Java. The design goals of XJ distinguish it from past work on integrating XML support into programming languages --- specifically, the XJ design adheres to the XML Schema and XPath standards. Moreover, it supports in-place updates of XML data thereby keeping with the imperative nature of Java. We have built a prototype compiler for XJ, and our preliminary experiments demonstrate that the performance of XJ programs can approach that of traditional low-level API-based interfaces, while providing a higher level of abstraction."

In particular, links after XLink can be "out-of-line" (i.e., not defined at a link source) and collected in (possibly several) linkbases, which considerably ease building complex link structures. Modeling of link structures and processing of linkbases under the Web's "open world linking" are aspects neglected by XLink. Adding a notion of "interface" to XLink, as suggested in this work, considerably improves modeling of link structures. When a link structure is traversed, the relevant linkbase(s) might become ambiguous. We suggest three linkbase management modes governing the binding of a linkbase to a document to resolve this ambiguity.}

However, an investigation of the XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) occurring in practice reveals that the vast majority of them are structurally equivalent to DTDs. This might be due to the complexity of the XML Schema specification and the difficulty to understand the effect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas. To shed some light on the actual expressive power of XSDs this paper studies the impact of the Element Declarations Consistent (EDC) and the Unique Particle Attribution (UPA) rule. An equivalent formalism based on contextual patterns rather than on recursive types is proposed which might serve as a light-weight front end for XML Schema. Finally, the effect of EDC and UPA on the way XML documents can be typed is discussed. It is argued that a cleaner, more robust, stronger but equally efficient class is obtained by replacing EDC and UPA with the notion of 1-pass preorder typing: schemas that allow to determine the type of an element of a streaming document when its opening tag is met. This notion can be defined in terms of restrained competition regular expressions and there is again an equivalent syntactical formalism based on contextual patterns."

In that context, one question which is often raised is how well XQuery interoperates with other XML languages, and notably with XSLT. XQuery 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 share a lot in common: they share XPath 2.0 as a common sub-language and have the same expressiveness. However, they are based on fairly different programming paradigms. While XSLT has adopted a highly declarative template based approach, XQuery relies on a simpler, and more operational, functional approach. In this paper, we present an approach to compile XSLT 2.0 into XQuery 1.0, and a working implementation of that approach. The compilation rules explain how XSLT's template-based approach can be implemented using the functional approach of XQuery and underpins the tight connection between the two languages. The resulting compiler can be used to migrate a XSLT code base to XQuery, or to enable the use of XQuery runtimes (e.g., as will soon be provided by most relational database management systems) for XSLT users. We also identify a number of areas where compatibility between the two languages could be improved. Finally, we show experiments on actual XSLT stylesheets, demonstrating the applicability of the approach in practice."

Two challenges in handling XML are its size (the XML representation of a document is significantly larger than its native state) and the complexity of its search (XML search involves path and content searches on labeled tree structures). We address the basic problems of compression, navigation and searching of XML documents. In particular, we adopt recently proposed theoretical algorithms for succinct tree representations to design and implement a compressed index for XML, called XBzipIndex, in which the XML document is maintained in a highly compressed format, and both navigation and searching can be done uncompressing only a tiny fraction of the data. This solution relies on compressing and indexing two arrays derived from the XML data. With detailed experiments we compare this with other compressed XML indexing and searching engines to show that XBzipIndex has compression ratio up to 35\% better than the ones achievable by those other tools, and its time performance on some path and content search operations is order of magnitudes faster: few milliseconds over hundreds of MBs of XML files versus tens of seconds, on standard XML data sources."

We present a concept for integrating an XPath view of the file system into a shell, which can be used to find files based on file attributes and contents in a very flexible way. The syntax of the command line language is backwards compatible with traditional shells, and the new XPath-based expressions can be easily mastered with a little bit of XPath knowledge."

This causes problems in all cases where information from these two worlds has to be brought together. Using a few rules for mapping the incompatible aspects of the two models, it becomes easier to process data in systems which need to work with relational and tree data. The most important requirement for a good mapping is that the conceptual model is available and can thus be used for making mapping decisions."

The fact that hidden-Web sources are very sparsely distributed makes the problem of locating them especially challenging. We deal with this problem by using the contents of pages to focus the crawl on a topic; by prioritizing promising links within the topic; and by also following links that may not lead to immediate benefit. We propose a new framework whereby crawlers automatically learn patterns of promising links and adapt their focus as the crawl progresses, thus greatly reducing the amount of required manual setup and tuning. Our experiments over real Web pages in a representative set of domains indicate that online learning leads to significant gains in harvest rates --- the adaptive crawlers retrieve up to three times as many forms as crawlers that use a fixed focus strategy."

Our approach is based on Hilda, a high-level declarative programming language with a unified data and programming model for all the layers of the application. Based on run-time properties of the application, Hilda's run time system automatically partitions the application between the tiers to improve response time while adhering to memory or processing constraints at the clients. We evaluate our methodology with traces from a real application and with TPC-W, and our results show that automatic partitioning outperforms manual partitioning without the associated development overhead."

These small-time authors fall into the same category as those early enthusiasts of the Web who were simply excited by the opportunity of using the new medium to share information that they cared about. With this insight, we create a lightweight structured data publishing framework called Exhibit that duplicates many factors we believe have contributed to the original growth of the Web. We argue that appealing to this segment of the Web population --- addressing their publishing needs and desires at very low cost in many aspects --- lets us leverage their labor to structure existing content on the Web that has previously been authored in HTML by hand and is remaining hard to harvest automatically."

As XML has become a performance-critical aspect of the next generation of business computing infrastructure, however, it has become increasingly clear that XML parsing often carries a heavy performance penalty, and that current, widely-used parsing technologies are unable to meet the performance demands of an XML-based computing infrastructure. Several efforts have been made to address this performance gap through the use of grammar-based parser generation. While the performance of generated parsers has been significantly improved, adoption of the technology has been hindered by the complexity of compiling and deploying the generated parsers. Through careful analysis of the operations required for parsing and validation, we have devised a set of specialized bytecodes, designed for the task of XML parsing and validation. These bytecodes are designed to engender the benefits of fine-grained composition of parsing and validation that make existing compiled parsers fast, while being coarse-grained enough to minimize interpreter overhead. This technique of using an interpretive, validating parser balances the need for performance against the requirements of simple tooling and robust scalable infrastructure. Our approach is demonstrated with a specialized schema compiler, used to generate bytecodes which in turn drive an interpretive parser. With almost as little tooling and deployment complexity as a traditional interpretive parser, the bytecode-driven parser usually demonstrates performance within 20\% of the fastest fully compiled solutions."

    abstract =  {Design principles for XML schemas that eliminate redundancies and avoid update anomalies have been studied recently. Several normal forms, generalizing those for relational databases, have been proposed. All of them, however, are based on the assumption of a native XML storage, while in practice most of XML data is stored in relational databases. In this paper we study XML design and normalization for relational storage of XML documents. To be able to relate and compare XML and relational designs, we use an information-theoretic framework that measures information content in relations and documents, with higher values corresponding to lower levels of redundancy. We show that most common relational storage schemes preserve the notion of being well-designed (i.e., anomalies- and redundancy-free). Thus, existing XML normal forms guarantee well-designed relational storages as well. We further show that if this perfect option is not achievable, then a slight restriction on XML constraints guarantees a "second-best" relational design, according to possible values of the information-theoretic measure. We finally consider an edge-based relational representation of XML documents, and show that while it has similar information-theoretic properties with other relational representations, it can behave significantly worse in terms of enforcing integrity constraints.}

Fresh content on a variety of topics, people, and places is being created and made available on the Web at breathtaking speed. Navigating the content effectively not only requires techniques such as aggregating various RSS-enabled feeds, but it also demands a new browsing paradigm. In this paper, we present novel geospatial and temporal browsing techniques that provide users with the capability of aggregating and navigating RSS-enabled content in a timely, personalized and automatic manner. In particular, we describe a system called GeoTracker that utilizes both a geospatial representation and a temporal (chronological) presentation to help users spot the most relevant updates quickly. Within the context of this work, we provide a middleware engine that supports intelligent aggregation and dissemination of RSS feeds with personalization to desktops and mobile devices. We study the navigation capabilities of this system on two kinds of data sets, namely, 2006 World Cup soccer data collected over two months and breaking news items that occur every day. We also demonstrate that the application of such technologies to the video search results returned by YouTube and Google greatly enhances a user's ability in locating and browsing videos based on his or her geographical interests. Finally, we demonstrate that the location inference performance of GeoTracker compares well against machine learning techniques used in the natural language processing/information retrieval community. Despite its algorithm simplicity, it preserves high recall percentages."

The mapping relations enable not only the discovery and retrieval of the WMSL pages, but also affect a new programming paradigm that abstracts many programming complexities from the script writer. Furthermore, the WMSL Web pages or scripts that disparate end-users write, can be harvested by Crawlers to automatically generate the concepts needed to build lightweight ontologies containing local semantics of a web service and its data model, to extend context ontologies or middle ontologies, and to develop links, or mappings, between these ontologies.

This paper presents models and algorithms to improve the display of tag clouds that consist of in-line HTML, as well as algorithms that use nested tables to achieve a more general 2-dimensional layout in which tag relationships are considered. The first algorithms leverage prior work in typesetting and rectangle packing, whereas the second group of algorithms leverage prior work in Electronic Design Automation.

In this paper we objectify the WS-* vs. REST debate by giving a quantitative technical comparison based on architectural principles and decisions. We show that the two approaches differ in the number of architectural decisions that must be made and in the number of available alternatives. This discrepancy between freedom-from-choice and freedom-of-choice explains the complexity difference perceived. However, we also show that there are significant differences in the consequences of certain decisions in terms of resulting development and maintenance costs. Our comparison helps technical decision makers to assess the two integration styles and technologies more objectively and select the one that best fits their needs: REST is well suited for basic, ad hoc integration scenarios, WS-* is more flexible and addresses advanced quality of service requirements commonly occurring in enterprise computing."

Examples of cDocs are a news article consisting of several html pages, or a set of pages describing specifications, price, and reviews of a digital camera. Being able to identify cDocs would be useful in many applications including web and intranet search, user navigation, automated collection generation, and information extraction. In the past, several heuristic approaches have been proposed to identify cDocs. However, heuristics fail to capture the variety of types, styles and goals of information on the web, and do not account for the fact that the definition of a cDoc often depends on the context. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of three machine learning-based algorithms for cDoc discovery. These algorithms are responsive to the varying structure of cDocs and adaptive to their application-specific nature. Based on our previous work, this paper proposes a different scenario for discovering cDocs, and compares in this new setting the local machine learned clustering algorithm to a global purely graph based approach and a Conditional Markov Network approach previously applied to noun coreference task. The results show that the approach outperforms the other algorithms, suggesting that global relational characteristics of web sites are too noisy for cDoc identification purposes."

One of the challenges of today's vast Web landscape is to monitor ongoing developments, put them into context, and assess their chances of success. One of the main virtues of a more scientific approach towards the Web landscape would be a clear differentiation between approaches which build on top of the infrastructure of the Web, with little embedding into the landscape itself, and those that are intended to blend into the Web, becoming a part of the Web itself. One of the main challenges in this area is to understand and classify new developments, and a better understanding of various dimensions of Web technology design would make it easier to assess the chances of success of any given development. This paper presents a preliminary classification, and presents arguments how those factors influence the chance for success."

A feature that becomes more and more relevant for our search and use of the Web is the geospatial reference of information. In this paper, we understand the Web as a vast geospatial information space in which most of the location information is still hidden inside the Web's content. We discuss the processes of uncovering hidden spatial information on the Web to realize a multitude of geospatial user scenarios. To explore the spatial character of the Web, location information needs to be discovered, understood, and augmented. By providing location insights into the existing Web, its content becomes accessible to spatial applications and thus allow users exploring the geospatial Web."

However, the Web as it is today has no overall location concept, which means that applications have to introduce their own location concepts and have done so in incompatible ways. By turning the Web into a location-aware Web, which we call the "Locative Web", location-oriented applications get better support for their location concepts on the Web, and the Web becomes an information system where location-related information can be more easily shared across different applications and application areas. We describe a location concept for the Web supporting different location types, its embedding into some of the Web's core technologies, and prototype implementations of these concepts in location-enabled Web components.}

    abstract =  "In this paper, we argue that in a local search, the what that is queried is implicitly about places and that geographic information retrieval would therefore benefit from an investigation of the semantics of place as a geographical entity. This investigation should include both the spatial and human components constitutive of the notion of place, without which the notion does not make sense. However existing knowledge representation (KR) models, such as ontologies based on logical theories, conceptual spaces, affordance or other, cannot capture in isolation all aspects of the meaning of a place. Therefore we propose to use a combination of them based on the underlying notion of difference. Differences are linked atoms of meaning. These nuances of meaning can be captured by using a variation of the technique of free association based on tagging, without committing to any KR model. Mapping to elements of different KR models can be made later to follow the requirements of a task. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for local search by applying it to the notion of place redefined as that location that supports a homogeneous affordance field while allowing the homogeneity of movement."

Roughly spoken, we derive a geographic representation for these location specifications from the top documents resulting from a query using the terms describing the location. These documents are parsed for toponyms and from these toponyms the region is derived. In the paper we describe an efficient process to derive the geographic representation for such situations at query time. Furthermore we present experiments depicting the performance of our approach as well as the result quality. Our approach allows for an efficient execution of queries such as camping ground near theme park or cycle path near brewery. It can also be used as a standalone-application giving a visual impression of the geographic footprint of arbitrary terms."

The paper then describes the portal's functionality, which aggregates, annotates and visualizes environmental articles from 150 Anglo-American news media sites. From 300,000 news media articles gathered in weekly intervals, the system selects about 10,000 focusing on environmental issues. The crawled data is indexed and stored in a central repository. Geographic location represents a central aspect of the application, but not the only dimension used to organize and filter content. Applying the concepts of location and topography to semantic similarity, the paper concludes with discussing information landscapes as alternative interface metaphor for accessing large Web repositories."

To exploit such location information, we need to find, extract and geo-spatially index relevant Web pages. For an effective retrieval of such content, this paper examines the application of focused Web crawling to the geospatial domain. We describe our approach for a geo-aware focused crawling of urban areas and other regions with a high building density and present our experimental results that gives us insight into spatial Web information such as location density and link distance between topical pages. Our crawls and evaluations back our hypothesis that adaptive focused crawling yields good results on the urban geospatial topic."

Fresh content about a variety of topics, events, and places is constantly being created and published on the web by news agencies around the world.

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for aggregating news articles according to the local news sources associated with the stakeholders of the news issues. This new paradigm provides users the capability to aggregate and browse various local points of view about the news issues in which they are interested. We implement this paradigm in a system called LocalSavvy. LocalSavvy analyzes the news articles provided by users, using knowledge about locations automatically acquired from the web. Based on the analysis of the news issue, the system finds and aggregates local news articles published by official and unofficial news sources associated with the stakeholders. Moreover, opinions from those local social groups are extracted from the retrieved results, presented in the summaries and highlighted in the news web pages. We evaluate LocalSavvy with a user study. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that news articles aggregated by LocalSavvy present relevant and distinct local opinions, which can be clearly perceived by the subjects."

We present our empirical study on a large-scale dataset with about 9,000 unique queries randomly drawn from the logs of a popular commercial search engine Yahoo!

Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are scalable and efficient. Patterns discovered from real world web click datasets reveal interesting patterns and show the evolution of the interests of people in those regions."

Search engines can often return better results to users by analyzing features such as user location or geographic terms in web pages and user queries.

As a result, major search companies have invested significant resources into geographic search technologies, also often called local search. This paper studies geographic search queries, i.e., text queries such as "hotel new york" that employ geographical terms in an attempt to restrict results to a particular region or location. Our main motivation is to identify opportunities for improving geographical search and related technologies, and we perform an analysis of 36 million queries of the recently released AOL query trace. First, we identify typical properties of geographic search (geo) queries based on a manual examination of several thousand queries. Based on these observations, we build a classifier that separates the trace into geo and non-geo queries. We then investigate the properties of geo queries in more detail, and relate them to web sites and users associated with such queries.
We also propose a new taxonomy for geographic search queries.}

A geographic search request basically contains a query consisting of one or more keywords, and a location specifying the geographic search area. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering co-located queries which are frequently searched over nearby locations. One example co-located query pattern is "shopping mall", "parking". This pattern indicates that people often search "shopping mall" and "parking" over locations close to one another. We formally define co-located query patterns and propose two approaches to mine the patterns. The basic approach is based on an existing spatial mining algorithm. To find more co-located queries that only appear in specific regions, we propose a lattice based approach. It divides the geographic space into regions and mines patterns in each region. We also define a locality measure to categorize patterns into local and global. Experimental results show that the lattice based approach achieves higher performance than the basic approach in the number of patterns, the quality of patterns, and the proportion of local patterns.}

While most of the DNS servers are configured to be used by their local users only, there still exist many DNS servers that respond to public queries. Querying these DNS servers reveals the recently visited domains. Exploiting the geographically distributed nature of DNS, one can gather usage statistics ranging from a single DNS server to global scale. In particular, this enables collecting statistics about geographic differences in web browsing behavior between different regions of a country or the world. In this paper, we present methods to identify these public DNS servers, discuss how to effectively crawl them, and describe our algorithm to extract usage estimations from the crawl data. We also evaluate our estimation algorithm using extensive simulations, and finally use our algorithms to crawl 150 U.S. universities for various domains, and explore the effects of location and time on the access rate of these domains."

The key idea in this work is to construct a social codebook, transform raw data into a 'book of life' --- a collection of social pages, each in turn is a sequence of encoded footprints. Computable patterns are then defined as repeated structures found in these sequences. Tackling this problem poses several challenges such as how to construct the codebook, how to define patterns and extract them. In particular, extracting high-order patterns are known to be a very hard problem. We address these questions and propose a Latent Social theme Dirichlet Allocation (LSDA) model, which is a personalized version of the Ngram topic models proposed recently. This model can be viewed as a Baysian clustering method, jointly discovering temporal collocation of footprints and exploiting statistical strength across social pages. Alternatively it can be viewed as dimensionality reduction method where the reduced latent space corresponds to hidden social themes or plans of user's daily activities. Applying to a real-world noisy dataset collected over 1.5 years, we show that many useful and interesting patterns can be computed automatically."

This paper presents a systematic study of the degree of coupling found in service-oriented systems based on a multi-faceted approach. Thanks to the metric introduced in this paper, coupling is no longer a one-dimensional concept with loose coupling found somewhere in between tight coupling and no coupling. The paper shows how the metric can be applied to real-world examples in order to support and improve the design process of service-oriented systems.}

The distribution of management responsibility of WWW based applications requires a decentralized approach to service management.

The Sitemaps protocol is a fast-growing web protocol supported jointly by major search engines to help content creators and search engines unlock this hidden data by making it available to search engines. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of how "classic" discovery crawling compares with Sitemaps, in key measures such as coverage and freshness over key representative websites as well as over billions of URLs seen at Google.

In this paper, we describe a next-generation personal information assistance engine that lets end-users delegate to it various simple context- and activity-reactive tasks and reminders. Our system, Atomate, treats RSS/Atom feeds from social networking and life-tracking sites as sensor streams, integrating information from such feeds into a simple unified RDF world model representing people, places and things and their time-varying states and activities. Combined with other information sources on the web, including the user's online calendar, web-based e-mail client, news feeds and messaging services, Atomate can be made to automatically carry out a variety of simple tasks for the user, ranging from context-aware filtering and messaging, to sharing and social coordination actions. Atomate's open architecture and world model easily accommodate new information sources and actions via the addition of feeds and web services. To make routine use of the system easy for non-programmers, Atomate provides a constrained-input natural language interface (CNLI) for behavior specification, and a direct-manipulation interface for inspecting and updating its world model."

Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85\%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it."

Our toolkit provides various strategies for synchronizing relational database tables between the browser and the web server, along with a client-side template library so that portions web applications may be executed client-side. Unlike prior work in this area, Sync Kit persists both templates and data in the browser across web sessions, increasing the number of concurrent connections a server can handle by up to a factor of four versus that of a traditional server-only web stack and a factor of three versus a recent template caching approach."

Especially popular within social networking services, short URLs have seen a significant increase in their usage over the past years, mostly due to Twitter's restriction of message length to 140 characters. In this paper, we provide a first characterization on the usage of short URLs. Specifically, our goal is to examine the content short URLs point to, how they are published, their popularity and activity over time, as well as their potential impact on the performance of the web. Our study is based on traces of short URLs as seen from two different perspectives: i) collected through a large-scale crawl of URL shortening services, and ii) collected by crawling Twitter messages. The former provides a general characterization on the usage of short URLs, while the latter provides a more focused view on how certain communities use shortening services. Our analysis highlights that domain and website popularity, as seen from short URLs, significantly differs from the distributions provided by well publicised services such as Alexa. The set of most popular websites pointed to by short URLs appears stable over time, despite the fact that short URLs have a limited high popularity lifetime. Surprisingly short URLs are not ephemeral, as a significant fraction, roughly 50\%, appears active for more than three months. Overall, our study emphasizes the fact that short URLs reflect an "alternative" web and, hence, provide an additional view on web usage and content consumption complementing traditional measurement sources. Furthermore, our study reveals the need for alternative shortening architectures that will eliminate the non-negligible performance penalty imposed by today's shortening services.}

Further, LBS subscriptions and user experiences are not easily portable across devices. We propose a general architecture for providing open and decentralized access to LBS, based on Tiled Feeds --- a RESTful protocol for access and interactions with LBS using feeds, and Feed Subscription Management (FSM) --- a generalized feed-based service management protocol. We describe two client designs, and demonstrate how they enable standardized access to LBS services, promote information sharing and mashup creation, and offer service management across various types of location-enabled devices."

Embedded computers or visual markers on everyday objects allow things and information about them to be accessible in the digital world. However, this integration is based on competing standards and requires custom solutions, thus requires extensive time and technical expertise. Based on the success of Web 2.0 mashup applications, we propose a similar approach for integrating real-world devices to the Web, allowing for them to be easily combined with other virtual and physical resources. In this paper we discuss possible integration method, in particular how the REST principles can be applied to embedded devices. Then we illustrate these principles with two concrete implementations: on the Sun SPOT platform and on the Ploggs wireless energy monitors. Finally, we show how RESTful interactions can be leveraged to quickly create new prototypes and mashups that combine the physical and virtual world.}

It was designed considering the human user as the one who guides service invocation and discovery. Attempts to provide machine-clients a similar autonomy have been proposed and recently, interesting discussions evaluate explicit semantics in the form of well-defined media types but introducing higher levels of coupling. We explore Web linking as a lightweight mechanism for representing link semantics and guiding machine-clients in the execution of well-defined processes and illustrate our approach with the OAuth and OpenId protocols in order to explore orchestration, asynchrony and machine-state expectations as the interaction is moved forward."

Looking at the Web level, it becomes necessary to consider new constraints and design issues. While certain scenarios might not map well to Web concepts, the opportunities and economies of scale available at Web scale make it very interesting to carefully examine how to eventually build a fully functioning and performant "Web of Things".}

Approaches which aggregate WoT ressources by centralizing all the resource information, have problems: total dependency on external infrasture, lack of private WoT management, inflexible communication patterns and limited dynamic ressource discovery and mapping. To solve these problems, we propose uBox, a local WoT platform which can be a stand-alone server to make your WoT environment, with interfaces to connect the other local WoT platforms. This way, which we call uBoXing, we can create World Wide WoT platform with a distributed architecture. This paper describes the concept of a distributed resource management architecture, and how we implement the concept into software. Also, we will discuss the platform with the example application in SmartTecO environment."

As both social overlays and user interface containers, online social networks (OSNs) will play a significant role in the evolution of the web of things. As user interface containers and social overlays, they can be used by end users and applications as an on-line entry point for interacting with things, both receiving updates from sensors and controlling things. Conversely, access to user identity and profile information, content and social graphs can be useful in physical social settings like cafes. In this paper we describe some of the key features of social networks used by existing social WoT systems. We follow this with a discussion of open research questions related to integration of OSNs and how OSNs may evolve to be more suitable for integration with places and things. Several ongoing projects in our lab leverage OSNs to connect places and things to online communities."

A final evaluation concludes with the current most fitting process notation for modeling real world processes using WoT technology and suggests extending established approaches by including WoT specific aspects."

We show how the use of blueprints that were successful on the Web can help to make the adoption of these standards less complex. We discuss in particular how Cloud Computing, RESTful interfaces, Real-time Web (Websockets and Comet) and Web 2.0 Mashups can simplify application development, deployments and maintenance in a common RFID application. Our analysis also illustrates that RFID/EPC Network applications are an excellent playground for Web of Things technologies and that further research in this field can significantly contribute to making real-world applications less complex and cost-intensive."

Such technology enables the creation of object-based applications mixing real-world objects that embed tiny Web servers with existing Web resources. To ensure the adoption of such applications, which potentially modify the behaviors of objects, it is needed that the overall system or architecture supports the mental models developed by users. In this paper, we propose a definition of object-based applications based on the literature review and present a protocol aiming at better understanding users' perception of smart environments. We then present our preliminary results and highlight the need of creating intelligible systems and tools."

Our approach permits fast and simple deployments of Smart Spaces composed of Web enabled objects. With the clear objective of confronting our approach to end users, we implemented a set of user interfaces to navigate within Smart Spaces and tools to intuitively design mashups composing real world resources.

We present PalimPost, a converged system for storing, searching, and sharing digital and physical world information using sticky notes and mobile devices. PalimPost extracts contextual cues from a user's physical environment and activities, and connects them to the user's digital world research. Subsequently, the system presents systematically categorized information that is relevant to the moment of interaction in a just-in-time manner. PalimPost uses physical sticky notes with embedded QR codes, as well as virtual sticky notes on mobile devices. The system incorporates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for understanding and categorizing the content."

Our simulation results show that trendy techniques reduce the control traffic considerably and also reduce the energy consumption, while offering the optimal service selection."

This failure, we believe, is hindering the adoption of the WoT and the growth of the community. We conclude the paper with a set of open questions, which, although not exhaustive, are aimed at opening up a community discussion on the needs of developers and how best the community can meet those needs and so further the adoption of the WoT. In essence, we believe that the time may be right to begin to agree on some basic functionality and approaches to WoT toolkits."

Based on our experience with implementation, we conclude that: (i) both the embedded and the middleware solutions can already be prototyped, but some critical technologies for the embedded approach are still in early development and require considerable improvements, (ii) XML like syntax is not well suited for storing and transmission of metadata due to sensor device constraints with respect to available storage and link datarate; and (iii) the middleware approach proved more convenient from the web application developer's point of view."

Consequently, these objects have to face well-known problems from the web world. The lack of expressiveness and human orientation of the syntactically described capabilities and contents of those resources is one of these difficulties. The Semantic Web on the contrary interlinks each object's data to one another, enabling its automatic process to reveal possible new relationships and therefore enhancing the interoperability of semantic-enabled objects. In this work we present a semantically enabled Web of Things compliant HTTP interface for Internet-enabled objects which uses Triple Spaces (TS) as a basis. Specifically, we address the adoption of this paradigm by a wide range of resource constrained devices assessing the feasibility of our middle-ware solution, focusing both on the web and on the semantic aspects. Besides, we stress the degree of interoperability achieved by the applications made using RESTful TS by describing two scenarios where it could be used."

Indeed, these devices should not only integrate seamlessly into the daily workflow, but their usage must appear as ordinary as possible to the different caregivers. Using RESTful architectures, it is possible to model custom objects in the health domain as resources, interact with them and combine them to mashup applications, enhancing and facilitating in a natural way the work of caregivers. We claim that embedding eHealth workflows into the Web of Things is not only possible, but even enhances the whole process. An alert is no more an isolated event, but becomes connected to other resources providing additional information about its general context. In this paper, we illustrate some of the challenges of bringing REST to the eHealth domain by studying an existing hospital laboratory alerts system and by proposing to generalize it in order to encompass the whole escalating process and exchanges of information among caregivers, patients and their medical records."

In this paper, we propose the concept of a computational marketplace as a framework to enable the analysis and aggregation of real-time data. Here, multiple tiers of hyperlinked algorithms from different providers interact to refine data within computational graphs, which are linked structures of cascaded processing steps. We present an analysis of the key constraints on such a framework and provide a corresponding implementation as well as results from evaluations in an experimental use case scenario.}

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g. HTML, URI, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g. browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share things. In this paper, we begin by describing a Web of Things architecture and best-practices rooted on the RESTful principles that contributed to the popular success, scalability, and evolvability of the traditional Web. We then discuss several prototypes implemented using these principles to connect environmental sensor nodes and an energy monitoring systems to the World Wide Web. We finally show how Web-enabled things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications called "physical mashups".}

The approach allows "follow your nose" style navigation both from the current time-generic resource to associated time-specific version resources as well as among version resources. The proposed versioning mechanism is congruent with the Architecture of the World Wide Web, and is based on the Memento framework that extends HTTP with transparent content negotiation in the datetime dimension. The paper shows how the versioning approach applies to Linked Data, and by means of a demonstrator built for DBpedia, it also illustrates how it can be used to conduct a time-series analysis across versions of Linked Data descriptions.}

On the other hand, the set of the architectural principles that underlie the human-readable Web has been conceptualized as the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. In this paper, we distill REST concepts in order to provide a mechanism for describing REST (i.e. human-readable Web) resources and transform them into semantic resources. The strategy  allowed us to harvest already existing Web resources without requiring changes on the original sources, or ad-hoc  interfaces. We illustrate our approach with an application and expect that the presented approach may contribute to the availability of more data sources and become a further step to lower the entry barrier to semantic resources publishing."

The "Location and the Web (LocWeb)" workshop targets the capabilities and constraints of Web-based location-aware services, which can be implemented as browser-based applications, or as native applications using Web services. The focus of this CHI workshop is on developing approaches to handle the complexity of location-aware services, specifically looking at location abstractions, location sharing, context-relevant information, privacy issues, and  interface design. The goal of this workshop is to serve as a starting point for better understanding how the Web has to change to embrace location as a first-level concept, and how these changes are reflected in applications and user interfaces to transform the Web into a platform for location-aware services.}

Augmented-Reality (AR) based systems can help resolve these issues by reducing the physical effort required to input keywords onto a small keyboard, and the mental effort necessary to review the search results. But most AR systems do not consider media sharing environments where individual systems are not interoperable in respect of their media and browsing abilities. In this paper, we focus on a media environment for interoperable augmented-reality systems, making the assumption that such devices will become more wide spread and that many people will share individual media in a real-world space. Furthermore, we describe such emerging scenarios and new research issues. We also present a model to manage the futuristic data, making it similar to existing physical media, and show a practical example using the system we have developed."

The rapid rise of multi-sensory mobile devices and Internet-enabled "things" equipped with sensors and ubiquitous connectivity opens new possibilities and provides the foundations to capture, share and use Web services and applications in ways which go beyond the traditional scenarios of stationary or even mobile computer-like devices. Increasingly, applications will have to bridge the physical world and the Web space, and location is one of the major connecting links. When Web services will "surround" users, designers have to address the challenges of scalability and interoperability on the Web, and designers also have to look at policy, regulatory, and legislative responses to the privacy and security challenges created by something as sensitive as location information.}

Our research is based on a data set consisting of 2289 locations gathered from a marketed iPhone application. In a first analysis, it became evident that the accuracy information differs significantly among iPhone and iPod and iPad devices. A second analysis of the accuracy values reveals clusters of accuracy values at above 1 km, at 500 meters, and at an accuracy of below 300 meters. Information with an accuracy of above 500 meters originated from Cell-ID based positioning. Finally, an analysis revealed that the accuracy is significantly reduced for locations with more than 500 meters away from the next populated area. The overall results suggest that additional Cell-ID based positioning technology allows for higher coverage at the costs of a significantly reduced accuracy. If location information is required, with an accuracy of below 300 meters, the technology should be limited to GPS and WLAN based positioning. Adding Cell-ID based positioning increases the coverage while accuracy is reduced."

For each trajectory we find the edges that were crossed, with the crossed edges we create a histogram in which the bins denote the crossed edges and the frequency value the number of times that edge was crossed for a certain user. We then select the K most frequent edges and combine them to create a list of the most frequent paths that a user has. We compared our results with the algorithm that was proposed in Adaptive learning of semantic locations and routes to find frequent routes of a user, and found that our implementation on the contrary of this work can discriminate directions, ie routes that go from A to B and routes that go from B to A are taken as different. Furthermore our implementation also permits the analysis of subsections of the routes,something that to our knowledge had not been carried out in previous related work."

Our research focuses on understanding what aspects of geo-referenced entities are mentioned in user queries in an attempt to create a model for user intents in geo-referenced Web searching. By collecting and analyzing geo-referenced questions posed to operational question answering systems, we delineated major aspects of non-topical information that people would seek in association with geographic information. The identified aspects were further conceptualized to develop a user interest model with three dimensions, which was validated with two sets of data. The model can be a basis for identifying user.s intent in a mobile search context as well as classifying geo-related text to be retrieved for its aspectual category."

The findings form a proof-of-concept for the adoption of location technology to transportation and behavioral sciences and suggest further interdisciplinary collaboration in these fields."

    abstract =  "In this paper we outline a unified architecture for representing locations of people, places and things in real or virtual worlds, called realms, on the web. Our architecture is based on the location graph that encodes web-level containment and connectedness relationships between locations. The architecture provides an information processing model that allows realm independent queries such as position, range and path, and realm specific queries, such as distance. We present existing systems that are enablers for the proposed architecture. With this architecture we enable a common way to develop location based services and applications across real or virtual realms, avoiding fragmentation."

The wide variety of tools, techniques, and technological solutions presented in WEWST share one common feature: they suggest new directions for Web service research by introducing new and sometime controversial ideas into the field.

They were initially motivated by organizations desiring dynamically coupled systems that would support rapid configuration, deployment, and reconfiguration. SoAs support multi-tiered architectures for enterprise backends as well as integration of multiple organizations via well defined interfaces. The success and popularity of SoAs in the Internet has driven the consideration of SoAs for tactical edge networks. However, tactical edge networks are considerably different from the Internet in terms of the type and number of nodes as well as the connectivity between the nodes. Nodes may be transient and resource constrained --- battery operated and with limited processing and storage. The communications between nodes may be wireless and ad-hoc, resulting in network partitioning and unreliable, bandwidth constrained, and variable latency links. This paper describes some observations of the target environments, requirements for SoAs for such environments, and experiences with developing SoAs for tactical edge networks."

The presented tool chain covers modeling with domain-specific Unified Modeling Language (UML) profiles, transformation of the UML models into Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) files, and Java code generation. The tool chain is validated in a case study where it is used in the development of a web service called Resource Availability Service (RAS). In the validation, the tool chain worked well, since the proportion of generated code in RAS is over 95\%. The residual 5\% of the code includes manual integration and business logic. User experiences indicate that using the tool chain improves the developer productivity in Web Services development."

However, existing methods build adaptors that process all messages exchanged by the protocols, even if only some messages cause a deadlock. We present an efficient, automated method to construct (if possible) a minimal adaptor for two business protocols containing parallelism and loops. First, the method finds the minimal set of messages exchanged needing adaptation, using behavioral relations on the protocol syntax to identify mismatches. Next, it generates in an efficient way an adaptor from the minimal set of messages. This minimal adaptor is compatible with the protocols, it reduces process complexity and it improves run-time performance of the automated service composition. We have implemented the method in a tool for adapting two business protocols. We apply it to an example case study from the healthcare domain."

While this work has been done in the context of a proposed update extension for SPARQL, our focus is on how to apply the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) to SPARQL. Our claim is that a RESTful redesign of SPARQL allows the Semantic Web to evolve in a more decentralized and openly accessible way than the current RPC-style design of SPARQL."

Unlike WSDL-based services, in REST the set of operations is reduced, standardized, with well known semantics, and changes the resource's state. Few attempts have been proposed to support composition models for REST, they are mainly operation-centric and fail to acknowledge the hypermedia nature of REST, that is, clients must inspect the served resource state and choose the link to follow from there. We explore RESTful service composition as it is driven by the hypermedia net that is dynamically created while a client interacts with a server resulting in a light-weight approach. We based our proposal on a hypermedia-centric REST service description, the Resource Linking Language (ReLL) and Petri Nets as a mechanism for describing the machine-client navigation."

RESTful semantic resources are described using the concept of tuple spaces being manipulated by HTTP methods that are related to classical tuple space operations. On the other hand, RESTful resources creation, destruction and other dynamic aspects of distributed HTTP computations involving coordination between HTTP agents and services are modeled using process calculus style named channels and message passing mechanisms. The resulting model allows for a complete and rigorous description of resource based web systems, where agents taking part in a computation publish data encoded according to semantic standards through public triple repositories identified by well known URIs. The model can be used to describe complex interaction scenarios where coordination and composition of resources are required. One of such scenarios taken from the literature about web services choreography is analyzed from the point of view of the proposed model. Finally, possible extensions to the formalism, such as the inclusion of a description logics based type system associated to the semantic resources or possible extensions to HTTP operations are briefly explored."

    abstract =  "Traditionally, distributed computing problems have been solved by partitioning data into chunks small enough to be handled by commodity hardware. However, such partitioning is not possible in cases where there are a high number of dependencies or high dimensionality, such as in reasoning and expert systems, rendering such problems less tractable for distributed systems. By instead partitioning the problem, rather than the data, we can achieve a more general application of distributed computing. Partitioning the problem rather than the data may require tighter communication between members of the network, even though many networks can only be assumed to be weakly-connected. We believe that a decentralized implementation of propagator networks may resolve the problem. By placing several constraints on the merging of data transmitted over the network, we can easily synchronize information and achieve eventual convergence without implementing mechanisms needed for serialization. To this end, we present the design of a RESTful messaging mechanism, currently in the process of being implemented, that allows distributed propagator networks to be created, using mechanisms that result in eventual convergence of knowledge across a weakly-connected network. By utilizing a RESTful design of the mechanism, we can also achieve a reduction of bandwidth usage during synchronization through the use of caching."

It requires service responses to link to the next valid application states. This frees clients from having to know about all the service's URLs and the details of its domain application protocol. Few services support HATEOAS, though. In most cases, client programmers need to duplicate business logic and URL schemas already present in the service. These dependencies result in clients that are more likely to break when changes occur. But existing services cannot be easily updated to support HATEOAS: Clients could cease working correctly when a service is changed. Also, client developers might not have access to the service's source code, be it for technical or political reasons. We discuss which information is needed to create a HATEOAS-compliant wrapper service for an existing service. We include a notation for modeling possible application states and transitions based on UML State Charts. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of our approach by comparing the clients for an existing service and its wrapped counterpart. Our approach enables client developers to wrap third-party services behind an HATEOAS-compliant layer. This moves the tight coupling away from potentially many clients to a single wrapper service that may easily be regenerated when the original service changes."

With this position paper we present a way how the hypermedia constraint of REST can still be fulfilled using a combination of Link headers, the OPTIONS method, and the HTTP Vocabulary in RDF."

RESTful web services are an alternative to Remote Procedure Call technologies like SOAP and WS-* services. There are many frameworks for implementing RESTful applications, but there is still a lack of support for the early phases of the development process, particularly analysis and design. For building formal models of RESTful applications an appropriate metamodel is needed. After analyzing existing approaches and techniques a first version of such a REST metamodel is presented and used to model an example application. Beside enabling modeling, such a metamodel offers a vocabulary for REST in practice and the basis for model driven development."

In this paper we argue that upgrading that which is under the covers to an XML-centric technology stack will result in a system that is easier to build, test and maintain. Further, these technologies are a step toward making construction of such systems available to non-programmers. We present an XML RESTful Services framework that provides mechanisms to address all of the key aspects of systems built in the RESTful architectural style."

However, in practice conforming to the REST's uniform interface constraint in Web-based services most often proves to be a difficult task, as identified by a number of researchers and practitioners. This implementation and conformance difficulty can be partly attributed to the lack of a systematic conceptual framework that could be used to interpret abstract architectural restrictions of interface uniformity to practical design decisions and strategies being generalized as interface design criteria. These criteria could be then mapped to domain-specific techniques that provide the context for guiding and/or examining the level of uniformity of a REST-based API. In this paper, we discuss such a conceptual framework and a collection of criteria that can be used to assess in a practical way as to whether a specific REST-based API conforms to the uniform interface constraint. As a proof of concept, we evaluated the proposed framework and its associated methodology by applying it to a collection of indicative public Web service APIs."

The binding of the disjunct components of this architecture creates security issues, such as the centralized authorization techniques respecting the independence of the underlying entities. This results in the question how authorization is performed respecting the flexibility of REST without any knowledge about the underlying resources. Nevertheless, possible knowledge about these resources should enable the authorization workflow to offer finer-granular permissions on substructures of the resources. With our new approach --- we named Hecate --- we offer a framework to assure simplified handling while keeping the potentials and flexibility of REST. We have designed an architecture based on XML with a flexible authorization mechanism on the one hand and optional resource-awareness on the other hand. The flexibility within the authorization workflow bases on permission sets respecting the HTTP-verbs. Additional in-depth knowledge of the entity optionally extends these permissions with resource-aware filters. Hecate offers not only great benefits because of its flexibility, but also because of the optional extensibility proved within the two reference implementations. With Hecate, we show that a centralized authorization mechanism combining independence and optional resource-based filtering extends the flexibility of REST rather than restricting it."

    abstract =  {So-called RESTful services are in widespread use both on the Web, and increasingly, in large enterprises. We say "so-called" because in reality, most of these services are not very RESTful. Those active in the REST community know well where these interfaces fail to meet REST principles, however, true understanding remains only in this relatively small community. Unfortunately, the result is a set of interfaces that are ultimately limited in their use, and the deficiencies are not usually recognized until it is too late to make the necessary changes. Our experience has shown that individuals are not being deliberately neglectful, rather, they simply do not know what they do not know. Everyone thinks they "get REST", after all, using HTTP to move XML or JSON payloads over the network is very simple. We have found that most individuals begin to understand the nuances of REST when they are explained and they almost always ask for resources that further explain these concepts. Certainly, materials are available, however the best ones are rather substantial in size lessening the chance that many people will read them. In this paper we take a fresh approach to explaining the core principles of REST, by describing a World Wide Web that fails to meet these tenets. We look at each key element, resource orientation, the uniform interface, media types and hyperlinking, and imagine the consequences of not abiding by the REST architectural style on the end user or tools developer of the Web. We then do a similar analysis in the context of Web services and programmatic consumers, reexamining each REST characteristic, describing common mistakes and suggesting improvements. We have found that in discussions, the analogy of the World Wide Web has been very effective at explaining REST.}

To support the adaption from RPC- to REST-oriented thinking, we propose RESTify, a straightforward procedure model to redesign a RPC-oriented interface into a hypermedia-enabled REST interface. RESTfiy uses a WSDL document of an existing SOAP service and consists of three iterations. The result of each iteration is an enhanced version of the preceding one concerning the REST constraints and is meant to be implemented as a HTTP service. Beside the technical result of the process and the design of a RESTful interface, the developer becomes acquainted to the main elements of a RESTful design, the constraints and their application. The results of the evaluation, using a prototypical web application and public SOAP services, are promising."

One of the crucial parts when adding a REST interface to an existing application is creating an appropriate resource model. Utilizing any available model of the legacy application can accelerate development significantly because existing domain knowledge, data, and business process implementations can be reused. Despite the maturity of the architectural style, there is still little record of creating a resource model from existing object-oriented applications. This article presents a lightweight modeling process: First we harvest an existing object model for resource candidates, afterwards the resulting model is enhanced incrementally until a suitable resource model emerges. The process is illustrated by a case study that highlights interesting challenges, such as a comprehensive domain model and long running processes, as well as pragmatic solutions for these challenges. The paper demonstrates that it is feasible to add a RESTful interface to a legacy application even in a process rich environment."

REST has proven to be a viable solution for such large-scale information systems. It provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, result in benefits in terms of loose coupling, maintainability, evolvability, and scalability. Unfortunately, some of REST's constraints such as the ones that demand self-descriptive messages or require the use of hypermedia as the engine of application state are rarely implemented correctly. This results in tightly coupled and thus brittle systems. To solve these and other issues, we present JSON-LD, a community effort to standardize a media type targeted to machine-to-machine communication with inherent hypermedia support and rich semantics. Since JSON-LD is 100\% compatible with traditional JSON, developers can continue to use their existing tools and libraries. As we show in the paper, JSON-LD can be used to build truly RESTful services that, at the same time, integrate the exposed data into the Semantic Web. The required additional design costs are significantly outweighed by the achievable benefits in terms of loose coupling, evolvability, scalability, self-descriptiveness, and maintainability."

While todaymore than ten years laterthe building blocks (1) resource-oriented rest infrastructure, (2) Web APIs, and (3) Linked Data are in place, the envisioned intelligent agents have not landed yet. In this paper, we explain why capturing functionality is the connection between those three building blocks, and introduce the functional API description format RESTdesc that creates this bridge between hypermedia APIs and the Semantic Web. Rather than adding yet another component to the Semantic Web stack, RESTdesc offers instead concise descriptions that reuse existing vocabularies to guide hypermedia-driven agents. Its versatile capabilities are illustrated by a real-life agent use case for Web browsers wherein we demonstrate that RESTdesc functional descriptions are capable of fulfilling the promise of autonomous agents on the Web."

The second contribution, is the combination of the data staging mechanism with a simple service deployment mechanism, that is designed to allow applications developed for the command-line to function as (RESTful) services without modification or (in some cases) recompilation. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of: (i) a peer-to-peer data-staging mechanism, that is itself RESTful, and (ii) a service deployment mechanism, also following REST design principles, which together form the Universal Distributed Data-flows framework, for the support of data-intensive (RESTful) workflows. We evaluate the framework by means of an engineering workflow developed for multi-disciplinary design optimization. The workflow itself is specified in Taverna, which is a conventional centralized data-staging enactment system. However, by virtue of the underlying services and staging mechanisms described here, the resulting enactment is peer-to-peer (for data), which furthermore permits asynchronous staging, with potential benefits for network utilization and end-to-end execution time."

Drawing from diverse sources including physical architecture, industrial design, the psychology of perception, and cross-cultural mono-myth, a new implementation paradigm is proposed to help software architects and developers meet these challenges; one that invites participants to shift their mental model from that of programming network devices to programming the network to which those devices are connected. To accomplish this goal an "affordance-rich message" is proposed; one that is based on shared understanding through network-oriented affordances instead of device-oriented APIs. A working model based on this approach is offered, examples given, and areas of related work identified.}

While integrating legacy software into new systems in general is considered by well-known approaches like SOA (service-oriented architecture), at the best of our knowledge, it lacks of ways to make legacy systems available for remote clients like smart phones or embedded devices. In this paper, we propose an approach to leverage heterogeneous (legacy) applications by adding RESTful web-based interfaces in a model-driven way. We introduce an additional application layer, which encapsulates services of one or several existing applications, and provides a unified, web-based, and seamless interface. This interface is modeled in our own DSL (domain-specific language), the belonging code generator produces productive Java code. Finally, we report on an case study proving our concept by means of an e-bike sharing service."

In this paper, we introduce distributed affordance, a concept and architecture that extends application state to the entire Web. It combines information inside the representation with knowledge of action providers to generate affordance from the user's perspective. Unlike similar approaches such as Web Intents, distributed affordance scales both in the number of actions and the number of action providers, because it is resource-oriented instead of action-oriented. A proof-of-concept shows that distributed affordance is a feasible strategy on today's Web."

In this paper, we try to unify the two concepts (services and their descriptions) by proposing a set of best practices to build self-descriptive RESTful services accessible by both humans and machines. Moreover, to make those practices usable with little manual effort, we provide a software framework that extracts compliant descriptions from documents published on the Web, and makes them available to clients as resources."

    abstract =  "Creating truly RESTful Web APIs is still more an art than a science. Developers have to struggle with a number of complex design decisions because concrete guidelines and processes are missing. Consequently, often it is decided to implement the simplest solution which is, most of the time, to rely on out-of-band contracts between the client and the server. Instead of properly modeling the application domain, all the effort is put in the design of proprietary JSON structures and URLs. This then forms the base for the contract which is communicated in natural-language (with all its ambiguity) to client developers. Since it is the server who owns the contract it may be changed at any point, which, more often than not, results in broken clients. In this position paper, we discuss some of the challenges and choices that need to be made when designing RESTful Web APIs. In particular, we compare how contracts are supposed to be established and how they are defined in practice. We illustrate the problems that are the cause of these divergences. As a first step to address these issues we describe and motivate an alternative, domain-driven approach to design Web APIs."

The current fragmented landscape of location concepts and location-awareness, however, is not suitable for handling location information on a Web scale. Providing users with mechanisms which allow them to control how they want to expose their location information, and thus allow control over how to share location information with others and services, is a crucial step for better location management for mobile devices. This paper presents a concept for representing location vocabularies, matching and mapping them, how these vocabularies can be used to support better privacy for users of location-based services, and better location sharing between users and services. The concept is based on a language for describing place name vocabularies, which we call Place Markup Language (PlaceML), and on various ways how these vocabularies can be used in a location-aware infrastructure of networked devices."

    abstract =  "XML is based on Unicode, and therefore XML documents may use the full Unicode character repertoire. However, XML-based applications often use XML interfaces to legacy software which in many cases is not capable of dealing with the full Unicode character repertoire. We therefore propose a schema language for XML which is capable of limiting the character repertoire of XML documents. This schema language, called Character Repertoire Validation for XML (CRVX), has features to permit or disallow character repertoire subsets from certain parts of an XML document, for example only for element and attribute names. CRVX uses information from the Unicode Character Database (UCD) to make character repertoire specification as easy as possible. CRVX is not intended to be the only schema language in an XML application scenario, but it provides useful additional schema-based validation to protect applications from unsupported characters. XML applications typically combine different schema languages before processing XML documents, and CRVX is intended to complement other schema languages such as grammar-based languages (DTD, XML Schema) or rule-based languages (Schematron). CRVX can be implemented in various ways. One simple solution is to use XSLT to transform an CRVX schema into an XSLT program, which is then used to validate XML documents. We briefly describe such an implementation. Other (and more efficient) implementations could be based on DOM or SAX parsers."

We also outline some important implementation issues; in particular, a dispatch algorithm that demonstrates how static type information can be used to obtain very efficient compilation schemas."

Schema evolutions may affect query results and potentially the validity of produced data. Nowadays, a challenge is to assess and accommodate the impact of theses changes in rapidly evolving XML applications. This article proposes a logical framework and tool for verifying forward/backward compatibility issues involving schemas and queries. First, it allows analyzing relations between schemas. Second, it allows XML designers to identify queries that must be reformulated in order to produce the expected results across successive schema versions. Third, it allows examining more precisely the impact of schema changes over queries, therefore facilitating their reformulation."

Many context frameworks have been introduced in the past few years. However, they usually do not consider the notion of characteristic features of contexts that are invariant during certain time intervals. Knowing the current situation of a user allows the system to better target the information to be delivered. This paper presents a model to handle various contexts and situations in information logistics. A context is defined as a collection of values usually observed by sensors, e.g., location or temperature. A situation builds on this concept by introducing semantical aspects defined in an ontology. Our situation awareness proposal has been tested in two projects."

We adopt a finite-buffer queueing model to represent the system. The arrivals to the queueing system are Web pages brought by the robots; service corresponds to the indexing of these pages. Good performance requires that the number of robots, and thus the arrival rate of the queueing system, be chosen so that the indexing queue is rarely starved or saturated. Thus, we formulate a multi-criteria stochastic optimization problem with the loss rate and empty-buffer probability being the criteria. We take the common approach of reducing the problem to one with a single objective that is a linear function of the given criteria. Both static and dynamic policies can be considered. In the static setting the number of robots is held fixed; in the dynamic setting robots may be re-activated/de-activated as a function of the state. Under the assumption that arrivals form a Poisson process and that service times are independent and exponentially distributed random variables, we determine an optimal decision rule for the dynamic setting, i.e., a rule that varies the number of robots in such a way as to minimize a given linear function of the loss rate and empty-buffer probability. Our results are compared with known results for the static case. A numerical study indicates that substantial gains can be achieved by dynamically controlling the activity of the robots."

    abstract =  "Current application development tools provide completely different programming models for the application server (e.g., Java and J2EE) and the client web browser (e.g., JavaScript and HTML). Consequently, the application developer is forced to partition the application code between the server and client at the time of writing the application. However, the partitioning of the code between the client and server may have to be changed during the evolution of the application for performance reasons (it may be better to push more functionality to the client), for correctness reasons (data that conflicts with multiple clients cannot always be pushed to clients), and for supporting clients with different computing power (browsers on desktops vs. PDAs). Since the client and server use different programming models, moving application code from client to server (and vice versa) reduces programmer productivity and also has the potential to introduce concurrency bugs. In this demonstration, we advocate an alternative solution to this problem: we propose developing applications using a unified declarative high-level language called Hilda, and show how a Hilda compiler can automatically (and correctly) partition Hilda code between the client and the server using a real Course Management System application. We illustrate our techniques using two clients: a powerful laptop machine and a less powerful PDA."

XPORT efficiently implements a generic tree-based overlay network, which can be customized per application using a small number of methods that encapsulate application-specific data filtering, profile aggregation, and optimization logic. The clean separation between the "plumbing" and "application" enables the system to uniformly support disparate dissemination-based applications.We first provide an overview of the basic XPORT model and architecture. We then describe in detail an extensible optimization framework, based on a two-level aggregation model, that facilitates easy specification of a wide range of commonly used performance goals. We discuss distributed tree transformation protocols that allow XPORT to iteratively optimize its operation to achieve these goals under changing network and application conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility and the effectiveness of XPORT using real-world data and experimental results obtained from both prototype-based LAN emulation and deployment on PlanetLab.}

    abstract =  "In this paper we address the problem of evaluating XPath queries over streaming XML data. We consider a practical XPath fragment called Univariate XPath, which includes the commonly used '/' and '//' axes and allows *-node tests and arbitrarily nested predicates. It is well known that this XPath fragment can be efficiently evaluated in O(|D||Q|) time in the non-streaming environment, where |D| is the document size and |Q| is the query size. However, this is not necessarily true in the streaming environment, since streaming algorithms have to satisfy stricter requirement than non-streaming algorithms, in that all data must be read sequentially in one pass. Therefore, it is not surprising that state-of-the-art stream-querying algorithms have higher time complexity than O(|D||Q|). In this paper we revisit the XPath stream-querying problem, and show that Univariate XPath can be efficiently evaluated in O|D||Q|) time in the streaming environment. Specifically, we propose two O(|D||Q|)-time stream-querying algorithms, LQ and EQ, which are based on the lazy strategy and on the eager strategy, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, LQ and EQ are the first XPath stream-querying algorithms that achieve O(|D||Q|) time performance. Further, our algorithms achieve O(|D||Q|) time performance without trading off space performance. Instead, they have better buffering-space performance than state-of-the-art stream-querying algorithms. In particular, EQ achieves optimal buffering-space performance. Our experimental results show that our algorithms have not only good theoretical complexity but also considerable practical performance advantages over existing algorithms."

In this paper we describe our socio-technical exploration of the devices, scenarios, and end-user interactions that will come into play as these tools become widespread. We couch this work in a discussion of the sociological impact of a shift from hyperlinks to "hyperties" --- links that bridge the gap between computational media and physical world interactions. We describe a prototype hardware device for location and other sensor data capture. This device links to a complementary website for querying, sharing, and distributing the resulting route datasets. The web application allows users to find related community members via shared attributes of their contributed or annotated routes. These attributes may be generated in part by route analysis performed by systems for activity identification and classification.}

NewsStand monitors RSS feeds from thousands of online news sources and retrieves articles within minutes of publication. It then extracts geographic content from articles using a custom-built geotagger, and groups articles into story clusters using a fast online clustering algorithm. By panning and zooming in NewsStand's map interface, users can retrieve stories based on both topical significance and geographic region, and see substantially different stories depending on position and zoom level."

Inherent to Twitter is an asymmetrical relationship between friends and followers that provides an interesting social network like structure among the users of Twitter. Twitter messages, called tweets, are restricted to 140 characters and thus are usually very focused. We investigate the use of Twitter to build a news processing system, called TwitterStand, from Twitter tweets. The idea is to capture tweets that correspond to late breaking news. The result is analogous to a distributed news wire service. The difference is that the identities of the contributors/reporters are not known in advance and there may be many of them. Furthermore, tweets are not sent according to a schedule: they occur as news is happening, and tend to be noisy while usually arriving at a high throughput rate. Some of the issues addressed include removing the noise, determining tweet clusters of interest bearing in mind that the methods must be online, and determining the relevant locations associated with the tweets."

Based on the refined segmentation results, we adopt template matching followed by greedy selection to locate individual tree crowns. As training a pixel-level classifier requires manual generation of ground-truth tree masks, we propose methods for automatic model and training data selection to minimize the manual work and scale the algorithm to the entire globe. We test the algorithm on thousands of production aerial images across different countries. We demonstrate high-quality tree detection results as well as good scalability of the proposed approach."

Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches."

Certain problems with privacy are closely related to the ways in which the technology attenuates natural mechanisms of feedback and control over information released. We describe a framework for design for privacy in ubiquitous computing environments and conclude with an example of its application."

This paper presents a system that allows users to control collaboration by enacting policies that serve as general guidelines to restrict and define the behavior of the system in reaction to the state of the world. Policies are described in terms of access control rights on data objects, and are assigned to groups of users called roles. Roles represent not only statically-defined collections of users, but also dynamic descriptions of users that are evaluated as applications are run. This run-time aspect of roles allows them to react flexibly to the dynamism inherent in collaboration. We present a specification language for describing roles and policies, as well as a number of common "real-world" policies that can be applied to collaborative settings.}

We argue that a focus on spatial models is misplaced. Drawing on understandings from architecture and urban design, as well as from our own research findings, we highlight the critical distinction between "space" and "place". While designers use spatial models to support interaction, we show how it is actually a notion of "place" which frames interactive behaviour. This leads us to re-evaluate spatial systems, and discuss how "place", rather than "space", can support CSCW design.}

The three classes of services can be found in each functional layer of our model. Our model is illustrated with a working system, the CoVitesse system, its software being organized according to our Clover architectural model."

    abstract =  "This paper considers the deceptively simple question: Why can't downloaded academic papers be managed in the simple and effective manner in which digital music files are managed? We make the case that the answer is different treatments of metadata. Two key differences are identified: Firstly, digital music metadata is standardized and moves with the content file, while academic metadata is not and does not. Secondly digital music metadata lookup services are collaborative and automate the movement from a digital file to the appropriate metadata, while academic metadata services do not. To understand why these differences exist we examine the divergent evolution of metadata standards for digital music and academic papers. It is observed that the processes differ in interesting ways according to their intent. Specifically music metadata was developed primarily for personal file management, while the focus of academic metadata has been on information retrieval. We argue that lessons from MP3 metadata can assist individual academics facing their growing personal document management challenges. Our focus therefore is not on metadata for the academic publishing industry or institutional resource sharing, it is limited to the personal libraries growing on our hard-drives. This bottom-up approach to document management combined with p2p distribution radically altered the music landscape. Might such an approach have a similar impact on academic publishing? This paper outlines plans for improving the personal management of academic papers --- doing academic metadata and file management the MP3 way --- and considers the likelihood of success."

    abstract =  "What happens when you can access all the world's media, but the access is constrained by screen size, bandwidth, attention, and battery life? We present a novel mobile context-aware software prototype that enables access to images on the go. Our prototype utilizes the channel metaphor to give users contextual access to media of interest according to key dimensions: spatial, social, and topical. Our experimental prototype attempts to be playful and simple to use, yet provide powerful and comprehensive media access. A temporally-driven sorting scheme for media items allows quick and easy access to items of interest in any dimension. For ad-hoc tasks, we extend the application with keyword search to deliver the long tail of media and images. Elements of social interaction and communication around the photographs are built into the mobile application, to increase user engagement. The application utilizes Flickr.com as an image and social-network data source, but could easily be extended to support other websites and media formats."

    abstract =  {The advent of media-sharing sites like Flickr and YouTube has drastically increased the volume of community-contributed multimedia resources available on the web. These collections have a previously unimagined depth and breadth, and have generated new opportunities --- and new challenges --- to multimedia research. How do we analyze, understand and extract patterns from these new collections? How can we use these unstructured, unrestricted community contributions of media (and annotation) to generate "knowledge". As a test case, we study Flickr --- a popular photo sharing website. Flickr supports photo, time and location metadata, as well as a light-weight annotation model. We extract information from this dataset using two different approaches. First, we employ a location-driven approach to generate aggregate knowledge in the form of "representative tags" for arbitrary areas in the world. Second, we use a tag-driven approach to automatically extract place and event semantics for Flickr tags, based on each tag's metadata patterns. With the patterns we extract from tags and metadata, vision algorithms can be employed with greater precision. In particular, we demonstrate a location-tag-vision-based approach to retrieving images of geography-related landmarks and features from the Flickr dataset. The results suggest that community-contributed media and annotation can enhance and improve our access to multimedia resources --- and our understanding of the world.}

The World Wide Media eXchange (WWMX) database indexes large collections of image media by several pieces of metadata including timestamp, owner, and critically, location stamp. The location where a photo was shot is important because it says much about its semantic content, while being relatively easy to acquire, index, and search.The process of building, browsing, and writing applications for such a database raises issues that have heretofore been un- addressed in either the multimedia or the GIS community. This paper brings all of these issues together, explores different options, and offers novel solutions where necessary. Topics include acquisition of location tags for image media, data structures for location tags on photos, database optimization for location-tagged image media, and an intuitive UI for browsing a massive location-tagged image database. We end by describing an application built on top of the WWMX, a lightweight travelogue-authoring tool that automatically creates appropriate context maps for a slideshow of location-tagged photographs."

At times the media component desired for integration, either as a navigation destination or as coordinate presentation, is a part of a file, or what we call a fragment. Basic media fragment integration has long been implemented in hypermedia systems, but not to the degree envisioned by hypermedia research. The current emergence of several XML-based formats is beginning to extend the possibilities for media fragment integration on a large scale. This paper presents a set of requirements for media fragment integration, describes how standards currently meet some of these requirements and proposes extensions to these standards for meeting remaining requirements."

In this paper, an approach is described which aims at providing group communication platform designers with a component which can be used for powerful group and session management functionality. This component, which can be integrated into group communication platforms, is part of a system called the group and session management system (GMS). The GMS model consists of GMS user agents, which are the components to be integrated into group communication platforms, and GMS system agents which are distributed directory agents providing the distributed database which the user agents access. Communication between these two types of agents is defined in two protocols, the GMS access protocol between user agents and system agents, and the GMS system protocol between system agents. GMS also defines a number of objects and relations which can be used to manage users, groups, and sessions on a very abstract level, thus providing both group communication platform designers and programmers of distributed multimedia application with a high-level description of group communications. This approach enables a truly integrated approach for collaborative applications, where all applications, even when using different group communication platforms, can share the same database about users, groups, and sessions. The paper also contains a short description of the ongoing implementation of GMS's components."

Ontologies constitute domain models formalized using expressive logic languages for class definitions and rules. Hence, when seen from an abstract point of view, the two paradigms and their various technological spaces seem closely related. However, in the state-of-the-art research and practice the two technologies are just beginning to converge and the relationship between the two is still under exploration. In this paper, we give an outline of current ontology technologies, such as the Semantic Web standards for a Web Ontology Language (OWL). Then, we describe a domain analysis of the different technical spaces, explaining the features of the different paradigms. Eventually, we describe some avenues for integrating various ontological technical spaces into metamodeling technical spaces."

Furthermore, these specifications cannot utilize reusing mechanisms which would reduce the size of the specifications and improve their readability. In this paper we discuss how to transfer means for structuring huge metamodels and models as provided by common modeling languages to the world of model transformation languages. We focus on generalization issues as well as on package dependencies. As a result we come up with an extension to our TGG approach that enables the user to specify structured bidirectional model transformations in a declarative way."

What began as an internet-scale distributed hypermedia system is now a vast sea of shared and interdependent services. However, despite the expressive power of REST, not all of its benefits are consistently realized by working systems. To resolve the dissonance between the promise of REST and the reality of fielded systems, we critically examine numerous web architectures. Our investigation yields a set of extensions to REST, an architectural style called Computational REST (CREST), that not only offers additional design guidance, but pinpoints, in many cases, the root cause of the apparent dissonance between style and implementation. Furthermore, CREST explains emerging web architectures (such as mashups) and points to novel computational structures."

    abstract =  "Software engineers confront many challenges during software development. One challenge is managing the relationships that exist between software artifacts. We refer to this task as information integration, since establishing a relationship between documents typically implies that an engineer must integrate information from each of the documents to perform a development task. In the past, we have applied open hypermedia techniques and technology to address this challenge. We now extend this work with the development of an information integration environment. We present the design of our environment along with details of its first prototype implementation. Furthermore, we describe our efforts to evaluate the utility of our approach. Our first experiment involves the discovery of keyword relationships between text-based software artifacts. Our second experiment examines the code of an open source project and generates a report on how its module relationships have evolved over time. Finally, our third experiment develops the capability to link code claiming to implement W3C standards with the XHTML representation of the standards themselves. These experiments combine to demonstrate the promise of our approach. We conclude by asserting that the process of software development can be significantly enhanced if more tools made their relationships available for integration."

The alternative is decentralization: permitting independent agencies to make their own decisions. Our definition contrasts with that of distribution, in which several agents share control of a single decision. Ultimately, the physical limits of network latency and the social limits of independent agency call for solutions that can accommodate multiple values for the same variable. Our approach to this challenge is architectural: proposing constraints on the configuration of components and connectors to induce particular desired properties of the whole application. Specifically, we present, implement, and evaluate variations of the World Wide Web's Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style that support distributed and decentralized systems."

With the growing amount of information available on the Web, and the more powerful hypermedia architectures made possible by new Web technologies, putting the content into context will become increasingly important. In this paper, a new way of structuring publishing systems for information providers is presented in an attempt to shift the emphasis in Web-based publishing from content to an improved balance between content and links. After a description of the architecture of a link-based publishing system, a strategy for implementing such a system is described. Finally, a number of challenges associated with such a fundamental transition in the publishing model are described, in the technical as well as in the organizational domain."

The difficulty is to make all those interfaces work together with the same application in an almost similar and transparent way and to keep them synchronized with each other during the lifetime of the application. Our approach is to describe the interactions of an UI rather than the elements or components with an XML description called IML --- Interaction Markup Language. Unlike UIML (User Interface Markup Language) those interactions are then assigned to technology specific interactions first, which in turn are then finally assigned to a particular implementation. An IML description is also stable against future developments: To enable the application for a new device, only the IML renderer has to be implemented."

The open-source Project JXTA was initiated a year ago to specify a standard set of protocols for ad-hoc, pervasive, peer-to-peer computing as a foundation of the upcoming Web of Things. The following paper presents an up-to-date overview of the JXTA protocols and describes the latest implementation of the JXTA protocols in the "C" programming language. The paper discusses the overall architecture and trade off made to allow the JXTA-C implementation to run on a wide range of devices including supercomputers, servers, PCs, and memory-constrained embedded devices. The JXTA-C implementation delivers a small and efficient implementation of the JXTA protocols stack allowing the JXTA protocols to be embedded at the system level rather than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) level for optimized performance and capabilities.}

Following the different tasks and problems within the development process the authors identify what appeared to be critical issues: requirements analysis, choice and mastering of Semantic Web technologies, representation of ontology and informational resources, creating interfaces for users and other services. Based on the project analysis, the article concludes by suggesting an agenda for the cooperation of administrative information managers and systems developers as a prerequisite for successful Semantic Web projects in e-government."

Each of these devices has its own specifics that require a special user interface. Therefore, we developed and implemented an approach to generate user interfaces for multiple devices fully automatically from a high-level model. In contrast to previous approaches focusing on abstracting the user interface per se, we make use of speech act theory from the philosophy of language for the specification of desired intentions in interactions. Our new approach of using communicative acts in high-level models of user interfaces allows their creation with less technical knowledge, since such models are easier to provide than user-interface code in a usual programming language. From one such high-level model, multiple user interfaces for diverse devices are rendered fully automatically using a number of heuristics. A generated user interface for a PDA is already in real-world use and its usability was informally evaluated as good."

The primary reasons people object to tag clouds are their visual aesthetics, their questionable usability, their popularity among certain design circles, and what is perceived as a bias towards popular ideas and the downgrading of alternative views."

As users and developers are focused more on performance than single copy consistency or the ability to perform ad-hoc queries, there exists an opportunity for a highly-scalable system tailored specifically for relaxed consistency and pre-computed queries. The Web 2.0 development model demands the ability to both rapidly deploy new features and automatically scale with the number of users. There have been many successful distributed key-value stores, but so far none provide as rich a query language as SQL.We propose a new architecture, SCADS, that allows the developer to declaratively state application specific consistency requirements, takes advantage of utility computing to provide cost effective scale-up and scale-down, and will use machine learning models to introspectively anticipate performance problems and predict the resource requirements of new queries before execution."

Of the basic technologies, URLs and HTTP has remained stable for some time now, and only HTML has changed more frequently. However, the introduction of XML has heralded a substantial change in the way in which content can be managed. One of the most significant of these changes is with respect to the greatly enhanced model for linking functionality that is enabled by the emerging XLink and XPointer standards. These standards have the capacity to fundamentally change the way in which we utilise the Web, especially with respect to the way in which users interact with information. In this paper, we will discuss some of the richer linking functionality that XLink and XPointer enable --- particularly with respect to aspects such as content transclusion, multiple source and destination links, generic linking, and the use of linkbases to add links into content over which the author has no control. The discussions will be illustrated with example XLink code fragments, and will emphasise the particular uses to which these linking concepts can be put."

Have we reached the end of the P2P revolution? In pursuit of legitimate data to verify this hypothesis, we embark on a more accurate measurement effort of P2P traffic at the link level. In contrast to previous efforts we introduce two novel elements in our methodology. First, we measure traffic of all known popular P2P protocols. Second, we go beyond the "known port" limitation by reverse engineering the protocols and identifying characteristic strings in the payload. We find that, if measured accurately, P2P traffic has never declined; indeed we have never seen the proportion of p2p traffic decrease over time (any change is an increase) in any of our data sources}

The current foundations of the Web 2.0, however, are strictly imperative in nature, which makes it difficult to develop applications which are robust, interoperable, and backwards compatible. Using a declarative approach for Web 2.0 applications, this new wave of applications can be built on a more robust foundation which is more in line with the Web's style of using declarative methods whenever possible. We show a path how today's imperative Web 2.0 applications can be regarded as a testbed as well as a first implementation for a revised version of Web 2.0 technologies, which will be based on declarative markup rather than imperative code."

Hyperlinked Web resources represent a rich information tapestry of content and context, instrumental in effective knowledge sharing and further knowledge development. However, the Web's simple linking model has become increasingly inadequate for effective content discovery and reuse. At the same time, rigorous but heavyweight solutions such as the Semantic Web have yet to garner critical mass in adoption. This paper analyzes the relative strengths and shortcomings of existing linked data approaches. It proposes a novel, lightweight architecture for the modeling, aggregation, retrieval, management, and sharing of contextual information for Web resources, based on established standards and designed to encourage more efficient and robust information reuse on the Web."

Web Engineering has become one of the core disciplines for building Web-oriented applications. This paper proposes to reposition Web engineering to be more specific to what the Web is, by which we mean not only an interface technology, but an information system, into which Web-oriented applications have to be embedded. More traditional Web applications often are just user interfaces to data silos, whereas the last years have shown that well-designed Web-oriented applications can essentially start with no data, and derive all their value from being open and attracting users on a large scale. Such an approach to Web engineering not only leads to a more disciplined way of engineering the Web, it also allows computer science to better integrate the special properties of the Web, most importantly the loosely coupled nature of the Web, and the importance of the social systems driving the Web.}

Such crawling activities can be regulated from the server side by deploying the Robots Exclusion Protocol in a file called robots.txt. Ethical robots will follow the rules specified in robots.txt. Websites can explicitly specify an access preference for each robot by name. Such biases may lead to a "rich get richer" situation, in which a few popular search engines ultimately dominate the Web because they have preferred access to resources that are inaccessible to others. This issue is seldom addressed, although the robots.txt convention has become a de facto standard for robot regulation and search engines have become an indispensable tool for information access. We propose a metric to evaluate the degree of bias to which specific robots are subjected. We have investigated 7,593 websites covering education, government, news, and business domains, and collected 2,925 distinct robots.txt files. Results of content and statistical analysis of the data confirm that the robots of popular search engines and information portals, such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN, are generally favored by most of the websites we have sampled. The results also show a strong correlation between the search engine market share and the bias toward particular search engine robots.}

    abstract =  "The Web 2.0 wave brings, among other aspects, the Programmable Web: increasing numbers of Web sites provide machine-oriented APIs and Web services. However, most APIs are only described with text in HTML documents. The lack of machine-readable API descriptions affects the feasibility of tool support for developers who use these services. We propose a microformat called hRESTS (HTML for RESTful Services) for machine-readable descriptions of Web APIs, backed by a simple service model. The hRESTS microformat describes main aspects of services, such as operations, inputs and outputs. We also present two extensions of hRESTS: SA-REST, which captures the facets of public APIs important for mashup developers, and MicroWSMO, which provides support for semantic automation."

Based on this analysis of available Web site metadata, it is easier for Web-oriented applications to be based on statistical analysis rather than assumptions when relying on Web site metadata. Our study of robots.txt files and sitemaps can be used as a starting point for Web-oriented applications wishing to work with Web site metadata."

The Web currently has no specific support for this kind of service pattern, and many scenarios use proprietary solutions which result in vertical designs with little possibility to share and mix information across various services. This papers describes an architecture for providing access to location-oriented services which is based on the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) and uses a tiling scheme to allow clients to uniformly access location-oriented services. Based on these Tiled Feeds, lightweight access to location-oriented services can be implemented in a uniform and scalable way, and by using feeds, established patterns of information aggregation, filtering, and republishing can be easily applied."

To show how such requirements can be satisfied by an existing composition language, we include a case-study using the JOpera visual composition language. In it, we present how to build a composite application (DoodleMap) out of some well-known, public and currently existing RESTful service APIs."

A key challenge in information integration is providing techniques and tools that manage and evolve these relationships over time. The structural computing domain provides a set of principles to derive new techniques and tools to help with these tasks of relationship management and evolution.

To this end, MATRIX has developed Media Matrix 1.0 an online, easy to use server-side suite of tools that allows users to locate specific media and streaming media files found in digital repositories and segment, annotate and organize this media online. This application provides users with an environment both to work with and personalize digital media, and also to share and discuss their findings with a community of users. Through creating a secondary repository of usage statistics and user-generated materials/metadata to supplement both traditional cataloging records and discipline-specific online indexes, tools like Media Matrix can help extend the usefulness of digital libraries without increasing costs to the libraries.",

XML-based data exchange has the ability to carry the full Unicode character repertoire, which is approaching 100'000 characters. Many legacy application are being Web-Service-enabled rather than being re-built from scratch, and therefore still have the same limitations. A frequently seen limitation is the inability to handle the full Unicode character repertoire. We describe an architectural approach and a schema language to address this issue. The architectural approach proposes to establish validation as basic Web Service functionality, which should be built into a Web Services architecture rather than applications. Based on this vision of modular an infrastructure-based validation, we propose a schema language for character repertoire validation. Lessons learned from the first implementation and possible improvements of the schema language conclude the paper."

Since 2000, the music industry has suffered declining sales, and very often this is attributed to the advent of the Internet-based peer-to-peer file sharing programs. We argue that this explanation is only one of several possible explanations, and that the general decrease in the economic indicators is a more reasonable way to explain the declining sales. Whatever the reason for the declining sales may be, the question remains what the music industry could and should do to stop the decline in revenue. The current strategy of the music industry is centered around protecting their traditional business model through technical measures and in parallel working towards legally protecting the technical measures. It remains to be seen whether this approach is successful, and whether the resulting landscape of tightly controlled digital content distribution is technically feasible and accepted by the consumers. We argue that the search for new business models is the better way to go, even though it may take some time and effort to identify these business models."

The de-sign process comprises three steps: prototyping, information modeling and system architecture design. The method is differentiated from existing design methods in that the design process commences from user interface prototyping. Information modeling activities are further enhanced in this method. To cope with the complexity of web systems, each design step is partitioned into both structural modeling and behavioral modeling. The design method is illustrated by applying the method to the design of a commercial web application."

It explores how such a model may accurately represent --- as far as practically possible --- the multitude of different objects we encounter in our surrounding environment and their many states and interrelationships. Three key propositions are that the context model should be of an object-oriented nature, that location is most appropriately and flexibly represented as a relationship between two objects rather than being considered as a special type of object unto itself, and finally, that objects may be coupled with observer-dependent validity rules that determine if the object is visible within the model."

An impediment to this mobility is the lack of integration in pan-European administrative processes. To solve the problems these business processes have to be made transparent to the citizen and public services need to be integrated. To do so, public administrations have to interact seamlessly vertically (Europe, nation, region, municipality) as well as horizontally (between countries) with each other. This implies not only the use of standards for data exchange but also the interoperability of business processes. InfoCitizen is a "proof-of-concept" e-government project in the context of the EU IST Framework Program 5 with a budget of more than three million Euros. Within InfoCitizen a European Information Architecture dealing with the interoperability problem has been developed. Based on these blueprints a prototype has been implemented and currently user-partners are evaluating the concepts and the system in interacting local showcases. In this paper the results of the project are shown by summarising the project so far. Findings are used to map out future tasks.}

However processes, shared where appropriate, are still the core element of inter-organizational knowledge, although in administration there is a greater emphasis on rules and legislation, and the payoffs to cooperating administrative units are not always clear. In this paper a layered architecture, derived from one previously proposed for virtual enterprises, is introduced. This architecture includes a high level service request layer, process guidance agents, context-aware work environments and the concept of "just enough" structuring.}

This growth is not only quantitative but also qualitative, in the form of increasing interdependencies between processes and information bits. Although the quantitative growth is relatively easy to handle, increasing information complexity is constantly pushing existing information systems to their limits. It is slowly becoming a self-proving fact that organizations will have to transition from the traditional model of searchable/updatable repositories of "facts and figures" to self-organizing, self-adapting corporate knowledge management systems. Ontologies and Semantic Web principles are the most promising relevant technology, now entering their mature age, allowing the creation of extensible vocabularies able to describe any semantic area. Project ONTO-LOGGING is an attempt to harness the full potential of ontologies as a flexible tool of knowledge management within any knowledge-driven organization, such as corporations and public ad-ministrations.}

In twenty contextual interviews in home and work place settings, we investigated how people encounter and save published material in the form of paper and electronic clippings. We found that sharing forms a significant use for encountered materials. Furthermore, the function of these clippings extends far beyond a simple exchange of content to inform the recipient; in fact, the content itself may have little immediate value to the recipient. We also found the practice to be ubiquitous: all of our participants had both shared clippings with others and received them themselves. Specifically, this paper reports on: (1) how sharing encountered items fits into the broader spectrum of clipping practices; (2) the function and value of the shared information; and (3) the social role of sharing the encountered information. We conclude that from a technological standpoint, we should think beyond an email model for sharing encountered information and, from a social perspective, we should attend to how sharing this sort of material contributes to the strength of social ties outside of a traditional information needs framework."

If there is a reason for them to share these personal annotations online, they must re-enter them. Given the advent of better computer support for reading and annotation, including tablet interfaces, will people ever share their personal digital ink annotations as is, or will they make substantial changes to them? What can we do to anticipate and support the transition from personal to public annotations? To investigate these questions, we performed a study to characterize and compare students' personal annotations as they read assigned papers with those they shared with each other using an online system. By analyzing over 1, 700 annotations, we confirmed three hypotheses: (1) only a small fraction of annotations made while reading are directly related to those shared in discussion; (2) some types of annotations --- those that consist of anchors in the text coupled with margin notes --- are more apt to be the basis of public commentary than other types of annotations; and (3) personal annotations undergo dramatic changes when they are shared in discussion, both in content and in how they are anchored to the source document. We then use these findings to explore ways to support the transition from personal to public annotations."

In addition, our algorithm annotates the generated hierarchy with geographical names.

As a consequence, traditional XML tools are of little practical use when dealing with overlapping markup. In this work we demonstrate the implementation of our framework for management of concurrent XML hierarchies from a computer science perspective. We propose an underlying model, data structures, APIs, and algorithms so that the most of the burden of managing concurrent XML hierarchies would be born by the software."

Several deduplication strategies are available, but most of them rely on manually chosen settings to combine evidence used to identify records as being replicas. In this paper, we present the results of experiments we have carried out with a novel Machine Learning approach we have proposed for the deduplication problem. This approach, based on Genetic Programming (GP), is able to automatically generate similarity functions to identify record replicas in a given repository. The generated similarity functions properly combine and weight the best evidence available among the record fields in order to tell when two distinct records represent the same real-world entity. The results of the experiments show that our approach outperforms the baseline method by Fellegi and Sunter by more than 12\% when identifying replicas in a data set containing researcher's personal data, and by more than 7\%, in a data set with article citation data."

    abstract =  "Although XML Document Type Definitions provide a mechanism for specifying, in machine-readable form, the syntax of an XML markup language, there is no comparable mechanism for specifying the semantics of an XML vocabulary. That is, there is no way to characterize the meaning of XML markup so that the facts and relationships represented by the occurrence of XML constructs can be explicitly, comprehensively, and mechanically identified. This has serious practical and theoretical consequences. On the positive side, XML constructs can be assigned arbitrary semantics and used in application areas not foreseen by the original designers. On the less positive side, both content developers and application engineers must rely upon prose documentation, or, worse, conjectures about the intention of the markup language designer --- a process that is time-consuming, error-prone, incomplete, and unverifiable, even when the language designer properly documents the language. In addition, the lack of a substantial body of research in markup semantics means that digital document processing is undertheorized as an engineering application area. Although there are some related projects underway (XML Schema, RDF, the Semantic Web) which provide relevant results, none of these projects directly and comprehensively address the core problems of XML markup semantics. This paper (i) summarizes the history of the concept of markup meaning, (ii) characterizes the specific problems that motivate the need for a formal semantics for XML and (iii) describes an ongoing research project --- the BECHAMEL Markup Semantics Project --- that is attempting to develop such a semantics."

These traditionally contrasting approaches to understanding documents are unified in an "Analysis Spectrum" in which presentational, structural, and content components assume different weights or status. Our methodology emphasizes reuse with a "Reuse Matrix," in which both business process (or document exchange) patterns and document schema patterns are organized by different levels of abstraction and scope. Enterprise-level patterns like "supply chain" and "marketplace" can fit into this matrix along with process patterns like "RosettaNet PIP" and document patterns like the "XML Common Business Library."

The Information Bus, our solution, is a novel synthesis of four design principles: core communication protocols have minimal semantics, objects are self-describing, types can be dynamically defined, and communication is anonymous. The current implementation provides both flexibility and high performance, and has been proven in several commercial environments, including integrated circuit fabrication plants and brokerage/trading floors."

It is suitable for personal collections comprising tens of thousands of documents (including papers, books, photos, receipts, email, etc.), and provides for ease of document entry and access as well as high levels of security and privacy. Unlike many other systems of the sort, user access to the document collection is assured even if the UpLib system is unavailable. It is "universal" in the sense that documents are canonically represented as projections into the text and image domains, and uses a predominantly visual user interface based on page images. UpLib can thus handle any document format which can be rendered as pages. Provision is made for alternative representations existing alongside the text-domain and image-domain representation, either stored or generated on demand. The system is highly extensible through user scripting, and is intended to be used as a platform for further work in document engineering. UpLib is assembled largely from open-source components (the current exception being the OCR engine, which is proprietary).}

While tools for three-way merge of ASCII text files exist in the form of the ubiquitous diff and patch tools these are of limited applicability to XML documents. We present a method for three-way merging of XML which is targeted at merging XML formats that model human-authored documents as ordered trees (e.g. rich text formats structured text drawings etc.). To this end we investigate a number of use cases on XML merging (collaborative editing propagating changes across document variants) from which we derive a set of high-level merge rules. Our merge is based on these rules. We propose that our merge is easy to both understand and implement yet sufficiently expressive to handle several important cases of merging on document structure that are beyond the capabilities of traditional text-based tools. In order to justify these claims we applied our merging method to the merging tasks contained in the use cases. The overall performance of the merge was found to be satisfactory. The key contributions of this work are: a set of merge rules derived from use cases on XML merging a compact and versatile XML merge in accordance with these rules and a classification of conflicts in the context of that merge."

In addition to these innovative features the wide deployment of XML introduces structured documents in many new applications including applications where text is not the dominant content type. In languages such as SVG or SMIL for instance XML is used to represent vector graphics or multimedia presentations. This is a challenging situation for authoring tools. Traditional methods for editing structured documents are not sufficient to address the new requirements. New techniques must be developed or adapted to allow more users to efficiently create advanced XML documents. These techniques include multiple views semantic-driven editing direct manipulation concurrent manipulation of style and structure and integrated multi-language editing. They have been implemented and experimented in the Amaya editor and in some other tools."

Furthermore, intelligent presentation generation engines have begun to appear, as have models and platforms for adaptive presentations. However, XML-based models are limited by their lack of expressiveness in presentation and animation. As a result, authors of dynamic, adaptive web content must often use considerable amounts of script or code. The use of such script or code has two serious drawbacks. First, such code undermines the declarative description possible in the original presentation language, and second, the scripting/coding approach does not readily lend itself to authoring by non-programmers. In this paper we describe a set of XML language extensions, inspired by features from the functional programming world, which are designed to widen the class of reactive systems which could be described in languages such as SMIL. The described features extend the power of declarative modeling for the web by allowing the introduction of web media items which may dynamically react to continuously varying inputs, both in a continuous way and by triggering discrete, user-defined, events. The two extensions described herein are discussed in the context of SMIL Animation and SVG, but could be applied to many XML-based languages."

Unfortunately, optimal layout of tables which contain text is NP-hard for reasonable layout requirements such as minimizing table height for a given width. We present two new independently-applicable techniques for table layout. The first technique is to solve a continuous approximation to the original layout problem by using a constant-area approximation of the cell content combined with a minimum width and height for the cell. The second technique starts by setting each column to its narrowest possible width and then iteratively reduces the height of the table by judiciously widening its columns. This second technique uses the actual text and line-break rules rather than the constant-area approximation used by the first technique. We also investigate two hybrid approaches both of which use iterative column widening to improve the quality of an initial solution found using a different technique. In the first hybrid approach we use the continuous approximation technique to compute the initial column widths while in the second hybrid approach a modification of the HTML table layout algorithm is used to compute the initial widths. We found that all four techniques are reasonably fast and give significantly more compact layout than that of HTML layout engines."

In the context of XSLT/XQuery analysis, query optimization, and XML type checking, XPath decision problems arise naturally. They notably include XPath comparisons such as equivalence (whether two queries always return the same result), and containment (whether for any tree the result of a particular query is included in the result of a second one). XPath decision problems have attracted a lot of research attention, especially for studying the computational complexity of various XPath fragments. However, what is missing at present is the constructive use of an expressive logic which would allow capturing these decision problems, while providing practically effective decision procedures. In this paper, we propose a logic-based framework for the static analysis of XPath. Specifically, we propose the alternation free modal $\mu$-calculus with converse as the appropriate logic for effectively solving XPath decision problems. We present a translation of a large XPath fragment into $\mu$-calculus, together with practical experiments on the containment using a state-of-the-art EXPTIME decision procedure for $\mu$-calculus satisfiability. These preliminary experiments shed light, for the first time, on the cost of checking the containment in practice. We believe they reveal encouraging results for further static analysis of XML transformations."

Our approach provides a method to quickly compute changes that are meaningful transformations on the XML tree level, and includes subtree move as a primitive operation. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach and benchmark it against a selection of existing differencing tools.

We consider these extensions in the light of World Wide Web Consortium standards, and illustrate their utility by a variety of use cases.}

However, most of the recent hyper-activity in research labs and in the marketplace falls short of Bush's vision. Most hypertext software is oriented toward hypertext as a new form of writing via incremental combination of bits and pieces of information. These hypertext programs typically provide little support for converting existing information from its more linear printed form, Where hypertexts have been created from existing text, they generally have been converted from a single encyclopedia, a single reference document, or a single system's documentation. Hypertexts that integrate the complete contents of more than one book or large document seem nonexistent, even though the expected benefits from such multi-document hypertexts were the original motivation for the concept.}

In this paper, we argue for the recognition of such a generalization, called structural computing, in which we assert the primacy of structure over data. We provide examples of four problem domains that are more naturally modeled with structure than data. We argue that support for structural computing must come in the form of new models, operating systems, and programming languages. We also assert that the experience gained by hypermedia researchers over the last decade may be naturally extended to form the basis of the new field of structural computing, and furthermore, the broadening of the applicability of our work is necessary for the continued vitality of our research community."

We are developing linking by inking in XLibris, a hypertext system based on the paper document metaphor. Readers use a pen computer to annotate page images with free-form ink, much as they would on paper, and the computer constructs hypertext links based on the ink marks. This paper proposes two kinds of readerdirected links: automatic and manual. Automatic links are created in response to readers' annotations. The system extracts the text near free-form ink marks, uses these terms to construct queries, executes queries against a collection of documents, and unobtrusively displays links to related documents in the margin or as "further reading lists." We also present a design for manual (ad hoc) linking: circling an ink symbol generates a multi-way link to other instances of the same symbol."}

Both libraries have been implemented with ease and efficiency, demonstrating the usefulness and reasonableness of the language."

These expectations can be traced to three different perspectives on the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web is portrayed as: (1) a universal library, to be readily accessed and used by humans in a variety of information use contexts; (2) the backdrop for the work of computational agents completing sophisticated activities on behalf of their human counterparts; and (3) a method for federating particular knowledge bases and databases to perform anticipated tasks for humans and their agents. Each of these perspectives has both theoretical and pragmatic entailments, and a wealth of past experiences to guide and temper our expectations. In this paper, we examine all three perspectives from rhetorical, theoretical, and pragmatic viewpoints with an eye toward possible outcomes as Semantic Web efforts move forward."

This has often been understood to mean that all levels of a structural computing system architecture should exhibit structure awareness, leading to data models centered around so-called "structural atoms." While systems based upon structural atoms do provide ubiquitous first-class structural abstractions, they also freeze the "granularity" of the structuring process throughout their architectures at design-time. That is, decisions regarding representations of structures in structural computing architectures based upon atoms cannot be recast at run-time. In this paper, we examine an alternative to atom-based models for structural computing systems that allows exactly such recasting. We demonstrate how this alternative model, which we call EAD, is superior to atom-based models for certain important applications, and describe our initial prototypical implementations.}

One of the key features of the Web's URIs is their ability to not only specify a resource, but to also identify a subresource within that resource, by using a fragment identifier. Fragment identification enables user to create better hypermedia. We present a proposal for fragment identifiers for plain text files, which makes it possible to identify character or line ranges, or subresources identified by regular expressions. Using these fragment identifiers, it is possible to create more specific hyperlinks, by not only linking to a complete plain text resource, but only the relevant part of it. Along with this proposal, a prototype implementation is described which can be used both as a server-side testbed and as a client-side extension for the Firefox browser."

In particular, links after XLink can be "out-of-line" (i.e., not depend at a link source) and collected in (possibly several) linkbases, which considerably ease building complex link structures. Regarding its architecture as a distributed and open system, the Web differs significantly from traditional hypermedia systems. Modeling of link structures and processing of linkbases under the Web's "open world linking" require rethinking the traditional approaches. This, unfortunately, has been rather neglected in the design of XLink. Adding a notion of "interface" to XLink, as suggested in this work, can considerably improve modeling of link structures. When a link structure is traversed, the relevant linkbase(s) might become ambiguous. We suggest three linkbase management modes governing the binding of a linkbase to a document to resolve this ambiguity.}

Systems that have a very formal representation of these semantics are able to manipulate the hypertexts in a sophisticated way; for example by adapting them or sculpting them at run-time. However, hypertext systems which require the author to write in terms of structures with explicit semantics are difficult/costly to write in, and can be seen as too restrictive by certain authors because they do not allow the playful ambiguity often associated with literary hypertext. In this paper we present a vector-based model of the formality of semantics in hypertext systems, where the vectors represent the translation of semantics from author to system and from system to reader. We categorise a variety of existing systems and draw out some general conclusions about the profiles they share. We believe that our model will help hypertext system designers analyse how their own systems formalise semantics, and will warn them when they need to mind the Semantic Gap between authors and readers."

In this paper, we focus on a type of logical information units called "compound documents". We argue that the ability to identify compound documents can improve information retrieval, automatic metadata generation, and navigation on the Web. We propose a unified framework for identifying the boundaries of compound documents, which combines both structural and content features of constituent web pages. The framework is based on a combination of machine learning and clustering algorithms, with the former algorithm supervising the latter one. We also propose a new method for evaluating quality of clusterings, based on a user behavior model. Experiments on a collection of educational web sites show that our approach can reliably identify most of the compound documents on these sites.}

In this paper, we examine how communities can be discovered through interconnected blogs as a form of social hypertext. We propose a method and model that detects structures of community in the social network of blogs by integrating McMillan and Chavis' sense of community along with network analysis. From the model, we measure community in the blogs by aligning centrality measures from social network analysis with measures of sense of community obtained using behavioural surveys. We then illustrate the use of this approach with a case study built around an independent music blog. The strength of community measures were found to be well aligned with the network structure, based on centrality measures. Even though the sample size from the case study was small, once the structure and measure of communities are calibrated according to our social hypertext model, communities can be automatically found and measured for other blogs without the need for behavioural surveys."

Tagging systems have the potential to improve search, spam detection, reputation systems, and personal organization while introducing new modalities of social communication and opportunities for data mining. This potential is largely due to the social structure that underlies many of the current systems. Despite the rapid expansion of applications that support tagging of resources, tagging systems are still not well studied or understood. In this paper, we provide a short description of the academic related work to date. We offer a model of tagging systems, specifically in the context of web-based systems, to help us illustrate the possible benefits of these tools. Since many such systems already exist, we provide a taxonomy of tagging systems to help inform their analysis and design, and thus enable researchers to frame and compare evidence for the sustainability of such systems. We also provide a simple taxonomy of incentives and contribution models to inform potential evaluative frameworks. While this work does not present comprehensive empirical results, we present a preliminary study of the photo-sharing and tagging system Flickr to demonstrate our model and explore some of the issues in one sample system. This analysis helps us outline and motivate possible future directions of research in tagging systems.}

Through a number of examples each challenge is discussed and HyCon, a context-aware hypermedia framework developed at the University of Aarhus, Denmark, is used to illustrate an integrated approach to ubiquitous annotations. Finally, a taxonomy of annotation systems is presented. The taxonomy can be used both to categorize system based on the way they present annotations and to choose the right technology for interfacing with annotations when implementing new systems."

In general after works are scanned they are indexed for search and processed to add links. This paper describes a new approach to automatically add links by mining popularly quoted passages. Our technique connects elements that are semantically rich, so strong relations are made. Moreover, link targets point within a work, facilitating navigation. This paper makes three contributions. We describe a scalable algorithm for mining repeated word sequences from extremely large text corpora. Second, we present techniques that filter and rank the repeated sequences for quotations. Third, we present a new user interface for navigating across and within works in the collection using quotation links. Our system has been run on a digital library of over 1 million books and has been used by thousands of people."

The XML schema representation we use is a language-independent formalism named XSchema, that is both precise and concise. A given XSchema can be mapped to a schema in any of the existing XML schema language proposals. Our proposed algorithms have the following characteristics: (1) NeT derives a nested structure from a flat relational model by repeatedly applying the nest operator on each table so that the resulting XML schema becomes hierarchical, and (2) CoT considers not only the structure of relational schemas, but also semantic constraints such as inclusion dependencies during the translation. It takes as input a relational schema where multiple tables are interconnected through inclusion dependencies and converts it into a good XSchema. To validate our proposals, we present experimental results using both real schemas from the UCI repository and synthetic schemas from TPC-H."

These new technologies present a difficult privacy tradeoff, as disclosing one's location to another person or service could be risky, yet valuable. To explore whether and what users are willing to disclose about their location to social relations, we conducted a three-phased formative study. Our results show that the most important factors were who was requesting, why the requester wanted the participant's location, and what level of detail would be most useful to the requester. After determining these, participants were typically willing to disclose either the most useful detail or nothing about their location. From our findings, we reflect on the decision process for location disclosure. With these results, we hope to influence the design of future location-enhanced applications and services."

Participants defined permissions for sharing of location, availability, calendar information and instant messaging (IM) activity within an application called mySpace. MySpace is an interactive visualization of the physical workplace that provides dynamic information about people, places and equipment. We found a significant preference for defining privacy permissions at the group level. While "family" received high levels of awareness sharing, interestingly, "team" was granted comparable levels during business hours at work. Surprisingly, presenting participants with a detailed list of all pieces of personal context to which the system had access, did not result in more conservative privacy settings. Although location was the most sensitive aspect of awareness, participants were comfortable disclosing room-level location information to their team members at work. Our findings suggest utilizing grouping mechanisms to balance privacy control with configuration burden, and argue for increased system transparency to build trust.}

This combination of reading with critical thinking and learning is called active reading. To explore the premise that computation can enhance active reading we have built the XLibris "active reading machine." XLibris uses a commercial high-resolution pen tablet display along with a paper-like user interface to support the key affordances of paper for active reading: the reader can hold a scanned image of a page in his lap and mark on it with digital ink. To go beyond paper, XLibris monitors the free-form ink annotations made while reading, and uses these to organize and to search for information. Readers can review, sort and filter clippings of their annotated text in a "Reader's Notebook." XLibris also searches for material related to the annotated text, and displays links to similar documents unobtrusively in the margin. XLibris demonstrates that computers can help active readers organize and find information while retaining many of the advantages of reading on paper.}

Building on theory developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in socio-technical environments as a practical matter."

By allowing users to retrieve documents from their own organization (hierarchy), another user's, the consensus hierarchy, or a time-based hierarchy, we provide access corresponding to different characteristics of knowledge tasks: they are personal, collective, social, and time-sensitive. In a class website experiment, we show that for a complex knowledge task, hierarchies are used more frequently than search. One surprising finding is how often students use others' personal hierarchies.}

In addition we describe the key design features of our implementation. We provide the results of an eight week field trial of this enterprise social bookmarking service, including a description of user activities, based on log file analysis. We share the results of a user survey focused on the benefits of the service. The feedback from the user trial, comprising survey results, log file analysis and informal communications, is quite positive and suggests several promising enhancements to the service. Finally, we discuss potential extension and integration of social bookmarking services with other corporate collaborative applications."

We performed a two week long field trial with 10 participants to observe usage and investigate any privacy concerns that might arise. We found that our participants used the motion information to infer location and activity as well as to plan communication, to help in coordinating in-person get-togethers, and to stay connected to patterns in each others' lives. Participants saw the motion data as mostly confirming their existing thoughts about the locations and activities of others and expressed few privacy concerns. In fact, they frequently asked for more information to be shared to make the application more compelling.}

We explore both the opportunities --- new local knowledge, and concerns --- privacy risks, raised by this implicit information sharing. We conduct two empirical studies: subjects create place data when using PlaceMail, a location-based reminder system, and elect whether to share it on Sharescape, a community map-building system. We contribute by: (1) showing location-based reminders yield new local knowledge about a variety of places, (2) identifying heuristics people use when deciding what place-related information to share (and their prevalence), (3) detailing how these decision heuristics can inform local knowledge sharing system design, and (4) identifying new uses of shared place information, notably opportunistic errand planning."

We investigate the incentives for annotation in Flickr, a popular web-based photo-sharing system, and ZoneTag, a cameraphone photo capture and annotation tool that uploads images to Flickr. In Flickr, annotation (as textual tags) serves both personal and social purposes, increasing incentives for tagging and resulting in a relatively high number of annotations. ZoneTag, in turn, makes it easier to tag cameraphone photos that are uploaded to Flickr by allowing annotation and suggesting relevant tags immediately after capture. A qualitative study of ZoneTag/Flickr users exposed various tagging patterns and emerging motivations for photo annotation. We offer a taxonomy of motivations for annotation in this system along two dimensions (sociality and function), and explore the various factors that people consider when tagging their photos. Our findings suggest implications for the design of digital photo organization and sharing applications, as well as other applications that incorporate user-based annotation."

Focusing on character and challenges of page revisitation, previous findings from seven to thirteen years ago are updated. The term page re-visit had to be differentiated, since the recurrence rate --- the key measure for the share of page revisits --- turns out to strongly depend on interpretation. We identify different types of revisitation that allow assessing the quality of current user support and developing concepts for new tools. Individual navigation strategies differ dramatically and are strongly influenced by personal habits and type of site visited. Based on user action logs and interviews, we distinguished short-term revisits (backtrack or undo) from medium-term (re-utilize or observe) and long-term revisits (rediscover). We analyze current problems and provide suggestions for improving support for different revisitation types."

In a four-week controlled field experiment, PageLinker significantly reduced time, page loads and mouse clicks. By presenting links in context, PageLinker facilitates web page revisitation, is less prone to bookmark overload and is highly robust to change."

We investigated this issue in the context of a mobile location sharing system. Specifically, we report on the findings of a field deployment of Locyoution, a mobile location sharing system. In our study of 56 users, one group was given feedback in the form of a history of location requests, and a second group was given no feedback at all. Our major contribution has been to show that feedback is an important contributing factor towards improving user comfort levels and allaying privacy concerns. Participants' privacy concerns were reduced after using the mobile location sharing system. Additionally,our study suggests that peer opinion and technical savviness contribute most to whether or not participants thought they would continue to use a mobile location technology."

We designed a new SSL warning based on recommendations from warning literature and tested our proposal with micro- surveys and a field experiment. We ultimately failed at our goal of a well-understood warning. However, nearly 30%
more total users chose to remain safe after seeing our warning. We attribute this success to opinionated design, which promotes safety with visual cues. Subsequently, our proposal was released as the new Google Chrome SSL warning. We raise questions about warning comprehension advice and recommend that other warning designers use opinionated design."

The DOM level 2 API, which has been conceived as a suitable hierarchy of classes, has its most natural mapping in object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java. This is also testified by the already existing implementations in those languages. However, as of today, most applications are commonly developed in C, because of its standardization, flexibility, efficiency and availability. In this paper we describe the current state of Gdome2, which provides a DOM implementation for the C programming language. The library is meant to become a key module of the Gnome architecture, supplying a range of facilities for an efficient, portable, and easy management of XML documents in the Gnome way. We conclude with a comparison between Gdome2 and Xerces, one of the more advanced and actively developed DOM implementations."

While offering various advantages and shortcomings, these efforts fall short of isolating the fundamental difficulty that gives rise to the problem. The simple tree model, which XML enforces, is a symptom and not the cause of this problem. Descriptive markup divides texts into content and markup. Or as previously stated by the authors, "Markup is metadata about #PCDATA." The fundamental problem is that all prior methods treat markup as static trees of metadata about #PCDATA. If that changes to: Trees are assertions about metadata, the fundamental difficulty of representing multiple trees in a single document instance resolves into a processing issue.}

    abstract =  "Representing multiple hierarchies within a single document has always been a problem for XML. To try to address the problems of representing multiple hierarchies and of annotating existing tree structures with type information (as in the PSVI), we have developed a layered data model based on the Core Range Algebra presented at Extreme 2002 by Gavin Nichol. This data model views documents as strings over which span a number of named ranges, each of which can themselves have associated metaranges with their own internal structure. To aid our experimentation with this data model, we developed a markup notation to reflect it, the Layered Markup and Annotation Language (LMNL), and have constructed several prototype applications to facilitate the extraction of single views, as XML structures, from LMNL documents. This paper outlines LMNL and discusses how its development has made us reflect on the nature of XML, schema and query languages."

    abstract =  "Of all the new features in XSLT 2.0, the ones that have caused the most contention --- and worry --- amongst existing XSLT authors are those involving typing: strong typing, static typing, and validation against schemas. These features have been introduced due to two general requirements: the requirement to align with W3C XML Schema, which entails using XML Schema's type system and validation methods; and the requirement to support analysis of queries prior to their execution and warn authors of potential problems with them. When XSLT authors express their concern about these changes, they are generally assured that, at the end of the day, if they don't want to use the new type-related features that XPath 2.0 brings, they can always ignore them by using processors that are not schema aware and do not carry out static type checking. In this paper, I'll look at the extent to which this assurance is true: to what extent is it possible to ignore the new typing features in XPath 2.0? If they can't be ignored, what are the kinds of changes that XSLT authors will have to get used to? And most importantly, do these changes offer users any real benefits?"

    abstract =  "This paper describes and explains the XIndirect facility, a W3C Note. The XIndirect Note defines a simple mechanism for representing indirect addresses that can be used with other XML-based linking and addressing facilities, such as XLink and XInclude. XIndirect is motivated primarily by the requirements of XML authoring in which the management of pointers among systems of documents under constant revision cannot be easily satisfied by the direct pointers provided by XLink and XInclude. Indirect addressing is inherently expensive to implement because of both the processing demands of multi-step pointers and the increased system complexity required to do the processing. XLink and XPointer (and by extension, XInclude) explicitly and appropriately avoid indirection in order to provide the simplest possible solution for the delivery of hyperlinked documents, especially in the context of essentially unbounded systems, such as the World Wide Web. XIndirect enables indirect addressing when needed without adding complexity to the existing XML linking and addressing facilities --- by defining indirection as a separate, independent facility, processors that only need to support delivery of documents are not required to support indirection simply in order to support XLink or XInclude. Rather, when indirection management is required, developers of XML information management systems can limit the support for indirection to closed systems of controlled scope where indirection is practical to implement. This paper illustrates some of the key use cases that motivate the need for the XIndirect facility, describes the facility itself, and discusses a reference implementation of the XIndirect facility."

In contrast, Berstel and Boasson have discussed XML documents in the framework of extended context-free grammar, modeling XML documents as Dyck strings and schemas as balanced grammars. How can these two models be brought closer together? We examine the close relationship between Dyck strings and hedges, observing that trees and hedges are higher level abstractions than are Dyck primes and Dyck strings. We then argue that hedge grammars are effecively identical to balanced grammars and that balanced languages are identical to regular hedge languages, modulo encoding. From the close relationship between Dyck strings and hedges, we obtain a two-phase architecture for the parsing of balanced languages. We propose caterpillar automata with an additional pushdown stack as a new computational model for the second phase; that is, for the validation of XML documents."

Entities solved a problem, and then became a problem themselves. The world is still waiting for a solution to the problems that entities create, though many of the solutions proposed (including my own) are either partial or create new problems. Fortunately, years of implementation experience in this area, in both SGML and XML, may provide guidance for ways forward."

Pattern queries are evaluated against XML documents using a non-standard form of unification (called "simulation unification"). Furthermore, Xcerpt supports so-called rule chaining (with recursion), which makes it suitable even for complex query programs. Due to its foundations in logic programming, Xcerpt can also serve to implement reasoning algorithms for the Semantic Web.}

Mapping colloquial vocabularies into other formats (e.g., symbolic logic or RDF) is a powerful tool for making colloquial XML tractable. Specifying this mapping is a way of documenting what the elements and attributes are supposed to mean and how they are to be used. If this is done only in English prose, humans can make use of it, but not machines. If machine-readable syntax is used to specify a mapping from the XML vocabulary into some well-known target syntax, the mapping can benefit both humans and machines. Simple examples illustrate how mappings can be defined using XSLT and how they can be attached to the schema defining the XML vocabulary."

We therefore propose in this article a different approach trying to maximize the retained structure instead of minimizing the edit sequence. Structure is thereby not limited to the usual tree structure of XML --- any kind of structural relations can be considered (like parent-child, ancestor-descendant, sibling, document order). In our opinion, this approach is very flexible and able to adapt to the user's requirements. It produces more readable results while still retaining a reasonably small edit sequence.}

To provide a meaningful example, we propose a new instance-based schema language, DTD--, that derives schemas from tagged sample instances according to the patterns. Since there are few patterns, every document can be represented by a simple grammar where grammar rules can be directly inferred from the document, without any ambiguity.}

The MuLaX document syntax is a non-XML syntax that enables multiply-encoded hierarchies by distinguishing different "layers" in the hierarchy by adding a layer ID as a prefix to the element names. The IDs tie all the elements in a single hierarchy together in an "annotation layer". Extraction of a single annotation layer results in a well-formed XML document, and each annotation layer may be associated with an XML schema. The MuLaX processing model works on the nodes of one annotation layer at a time through XPath-like navigation. CONCUR lives!}

While XML itself has a clear versioning scheme through the version attribute in the prolog, XML-based languages such as Atom do not have a standardized versioning mechanism. We propose namespace documents as the logical solution. It could be claimed that such an approach is not needed by current markup practice in XML. However, as shown by the recent confusion the introduction of the xml:id name caused, at least seems some clarification of the gap between what W3C Recommendations actually define about namespaces and what many people think they define (as well as W3C good practice) is in order. Once we understand namespaces, XMLVS shows that the namespace document is both an effective and practical solution for maintaining XML languages. The XML-based language XMLVS (XML Versioning System) makes the maintaining, documenting, and versioning of XML languages easier by automatically producing best-practice human and machine-readable namespace documents for XML languages."

Like CONCUR, rabbit/duck grammars manage validation by means of several context-free grammars, but rabbit/duck grammars offer some improvements over CONCUR: within a document grammar written for one hierarchical subset of the markup vocabulary, the start- and end-tags of other hierarchies may be made visible; rabbit/duck grammars thus make it possible to constrain the interactions of different hierarchies in ways not possible with CONCUR. Rabbit/duck grammars also provide a more principled account of self-overlap (i.e. overlap of two elements with the same generic identifier) than CONCUR. Documents can be validated against rabbit/duck grammars either by validating individually against each grammar or by a single pass through the document which validates against all grammars simultaneously. An implementation of this single-pass approach using Brzozowski derivatives is sketched out."

In this paper, we first argue that the usual pragmatical approaches to specifying the semantics of XML models do not allow authoring environments to easily provide sufficient semantic support to authors, whereas syntactic support is profusely available. Then, we sketch a semantic framework (provisionally called intertextual semantics), which we think could allow modelers to specify the semantics of their models in a form that can be turned into semantic support to authors in authoring environments. We discuss the pros and cons of the proposed framework, as well as avenues for further work."

The motivation for the design of this architecture is the observation that generic support for group communications is an area which received not much attention until now. The design is based on two components, a Group Management System (GMS) and Group Communication Support (GCS). The GMS is responsible for managing the name space of the support platform. Users and groups are the two entities of the name space, and two different relationships between them (membership and manager) can be established. This way it is possible to reflect the structure of collaborative workers inside the GMS. The GCS component is responsible for establishing connections between collaborative applications using the GMS/GCS and for hiding the details of the multicast transport infrastructure from the application. It is possible to bind users and groups to specific applications and multicast transport services. This way any group can be used by different applications using different transport services. The main advantages of GMS/GCS are reduced implementation costs, a shared name space of users and groups, and a simple interface to different multicast transport services."

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through vertical system designs, we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. In such an architecture, popular Web technologies (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP, Ruby) can be used to build applications involving smart things, and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact with and share these devices. In this chapter, we describe the Web of Things (WoT) architecture and best practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and evolvability of the Web. We discuss several prototypes using these principles, which connect environmental sensor nodes, energy monitoring systems, and RFID-tagged objects to the Web. We also show how Web-enabled smart things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications, called "physical mashups", and discuss some of the remaining challenges towards the global World Wide Web of Things.}

    abstract =  {Many of the initial developments towards the Internet of Things have focused on the combination of Auto-ID and networked infrastructures in business-to-business logistics and product lifecycle applications. However, the Internet of Things is more than a business tool for managing business processes more efficiently and more effectively --- it will also enable a more convenient way of life. Since the term "Internet of Things" first came to attention when the Auto-ID Center launched their initial vision for the EPC network for automatically identifying and tracing the flow of goods within supply-chains, increasing numbers of researchers and practitioners have further developed this vision. The authors in this book provide a research perspective on current and future developments in the Internet of Things. The different chapters cover a broad range of topics from system design aspects and core architectural approaches to end-user participation, business perspectives and applications.}

We present the data structures used, the features extracted, the infrastructure needed, and the options available for designing a brand new search engine. We highlight techniques that improve relevance of results, discuss trade-offs to best utilize machine resources, and cover distributed processing concepts in this context. In particular, we delve into the topics of indexing phrases instead of terms, storage in memory vs. on disk, and data partitioning. We will finish with some thoughts on information organization for the newly emerging data-forms."

However, the Web as it is today has no overall location concept, which means that applications have to introduce their own location concepts and have done so in incompatible ways. On the other hand, there are a number of interfaces and techniques that make location information available to networked devices. By turning the Web into a location-aware Web location-oriented applications get better support for their location concepts on the Web, and the Web becomes an information system where location-related information can be more easily shared across different applications and application areas. This chapter describes a location concept for the Web supporting different location types and its embedding into some of the Web's core technologies."

ShaRef ist als Web-basierter Dienst aufgebaut, der als Komponente in die ICT-Landschaft einer Hochschule integriert werden kann. Die Konzeption von ShaRef sieht vor, dass Anbindungen an andere Komponenten oder Applikationen einfach vorgenommen werden k\"onnen. Dies wird dadurch erreicht, dass \"uber XML ein offenes Datenmodell unterst\"utzt wird, und dass der Aufwand zur Implementierung und Integration neuer Schnittstellen so gering wie m\"oglich gehalten wird.

Wo stehen die Hochschulen heute in der programmatischen Umsetzung? Dieses Buch beantwortet die Frage anhand von zwei Beispielen der ETH Z\"urich: dem auf breite, info-strukturelle Ver\"anderungen ausgerichteten Programm ETH World und dem auf die F\"orderung innovativer Lehre bezogenen Fonds filep. Visionen der Hochschulentwicklung werden ebenso diskutiert wie die Problematik der Evaluation komplexer Programme. Unter arbeitspsychologischer Perspektive werden Ver\"anderungen analysiert, die sich mit dem Einsatz neuer Technologien f\"ur den Arbeitsplatz Hochschule ergeben, und verschiedene Projektberichte zeigen auf, wie der innovative Einsatz neuer Technologien in den unterschiedlichen Bereichen einer Hochschule (Administration, Bibliothek, Lehre, Forschung und Infrastruktur) gelingen kann. Das Ziel dieses Herausgeberbandes ist es, die komplexe Dynamik aufgabenbezogener, sozialer und institutioneller Faktoren bei der Umsetzung technologiebezogener Innovationsprozesse zu zeigen und damit auch M\"oglichkeiten der zuk\"unftigen Gestaltung von Programminitiativen zur Einbindung von IKT in universit\"ares Arbeiten zu diskutieren.}

Crawlers facilitate the process by following the hyperlinks in Web pages to automatically download a partial snapshot of the Web. While some systems rely on crawlers that exhaustively crawl the Web, others incorporate "focus" within their crawlers to harvest application or topic specific collections. We discuss the basic issues related with developing a crawling infrastructure. This is followed by a review of several topical crawling algorithms, and evaluation metrics that may be used to judge their performance. While many innovative applications of Web crawling are still being invented, we take a brief look at some developed in the past.}

For example, a document usually needs preliminary processing in order to obtain the relevant information in an effective and useful format, so as to be automatically processed by the system. The objective of this chapter is to support other chapters, providing a basic overview of the most common and useful techniques and approaches related with document modeling. This chapter describes high-level techniques to model Web documents, such as the Vector Space Model and a number of AI approaches, such as Semantic Networks, Neural Networks and Bayesian Networks. This chapter is not meant to act as a substitute of more comprehensive discussions about the topics presented. Rather, it provides a brief and informal introduction to the main concepts of document modeling, also focusing on the systems that are presented in the rest of the book as concrete examples of the related concepts."

Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to re commend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user."

Due to characteristics of the web --- including a screen-centric publishing model, a multitude of output devices, uncertain delivery, strong user preferences, and the possibility for later binding between content and style --- the hypothesis is that the web calls for different style sheet languages than does traditional electronic publishing. Style sheet languages that were developed and used prior to the web are analyzed and compared with style sheet proposals for the web between 1993-1996. The dissertation describes the design of a web-centric style sheet language known as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS has several notable features including: cascading, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, forward-compatible parsing rules, support for different media types, and a strong emphasis on selectors. Problems in CSS are analyzed, and recommended future research is described."

    abstract =  "The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software."

Therefore, we suggest to structure the original task into two asynchronous preparation phases, one without and one with a link to the audio conference. This is followed by the actual conference and the assessment phase, which ends one itineration of processing the original task. The object-oriented audio conference software is written in C/C++ and runs on Sun workstations under SunOS 5.3 The audio mixing part is based on IBM compatible PCs running DOS. The PCs are equipped with ISDN interfaces, an analogue telephone interface, a digital signal processor board, and Ethernet interface cards allowing network access over TCP/IP. The audio conferencing service can be fully accessed and controlled over the Internet. The system is realizable with existing low-cost workstation technology, but still provides a good audio conference signal and a user-friendly interface."

    abstract =  "To study acoustic effects in premixed laminar flames the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with stiff source terms for the chemistry are numerically solved by a cell centered finite volume method. Three basic numerical problems are discussed which deal with gas mixtures, convergence acceleration for subsonic simulations and the computation of the inviscid fluxes at the volume interfaces taking the viscous terms, the source terms and 2D effects into account. Conservative Euler solvers for gas mixtures produce numerical errors, if the temperature and the ratio of specific heats are not constant. For mixtures of calorically perfect gases, a simple correction of the total energy per unit volume is proposed to avoid these errors. This is done in a physical way and only the total energy looses some of its conservativity. Numerical simulations of contact discontinuity convection, a shock tube problem and shock-interface interactions in 1D and 2D yield much more accurate solutions, if the correction is applied. The straightforward extension to 3D is outlined. As the ratio of the acoustic and entropy wave speeds is large for low Mach number flames, a lot of time steps are necessary with an explicit scheme to simulate a contact discontinuity crossing the computational domain. An easy way is shown how one can use much larger time steps with an explicit code to obtain the steady state solution. The method is based on the idea that the ratio of the acoustic and entropy wave speeds gets closer to one by subtracting a constant value from the pressure in the whole field. Only the inviscid terms of the energy equation are influenced by that pressure decrease. As long as compressibility effects remain small, the error remains small. Moreover, the error can be corrected by solving a scalar equation after each time step such that the steady state solution of the modified scheme is equal to the steady state of the non-modified scheme. Applying a conventional Riemann solver for flame simulations and even for 2D Euler simulations without source terms can lead to dramatic inaccuracies. A new approach for a flux solver is introduced, which takes viscous terms, source terms and 2D effects into account. The basic idea is to distribute the source terms, which also contain the viscous terms and 2D effects, to the corresponding volume interfaces. The price is a nonlinear algebraic system for six unknowns instead of a linear system for three unknowns to evaluate the fluxes. Simulations of premixed laminar flames in 1D and 2D and a 2D Euler simulation without source terms yield much more accurate results, if the new solver is applied. Unsteady simulations of two colliding flames producing sound show results which correspond almost precisely to the analytic solution. Thus, opposed to conventional Riemann solvers, our new flux solver is able to compute acoustic effects in flames accurately. Finally numerical results of acoustic interaction with a 2D Bunsen flame show a flattened flame shape which is at least qualitatively comparable with experimental measurements. The present approach for a flux solver is more general and can be applied to solve other systems of partial differential equations which contain inviscid terms, e.g. for the shallow water equations."

    abstract =  "This thesis deals with the design and implementation of a group and session management system for collaborative applications. The need for such a system has been identified during work on group communication systems and collaborative applications. Currently, the support for collaborative applications provided by group communication systems is not very powerful (from the point of view of designers of collaborative applications). The goal of this thesis is to develop a system which provides designers of collaborative applications with group and session management functionality that can be used to easily build group communications. The architecture of the group and session management system (GMS) consists of a component which is integrated on the user side (typically, the direct user of the group and session management system is a group communication system), and a specialized directory service which is accessed by the user-side component. The two main aspects of the group and session management system are the data model and the functional model. The data model describes the object types which can be used for group and session management and the operations which can be used with these object types. The functional model describes how the operations are carried out inside GMS, ie how GMS works internally. The GMS data model consists of six object types and a number of relations which can be established between objects of these types. The user object type represents a person or entity using GMS. Each user has an identity (a name) and one or more methods of self-authentication. The group object type is used to define groups which can consist of users and/or groups. The flow object type represents one connection for data transport. The session data type is the main metaphor for group communication. Each session is used to logically group a number of flows and to create an abstraction for management, authorization, and admission control for flows. Two additional object types are certificates and flow templates, which are used for security purposes and for storing information related to the creation of flows. GMS is a distributed system which defines two protocols: an access protocol for communicating with the distributed system, and a system protocol for communications between the distributed entities of the system. The access protocol is based on a reliable, connection-oriented transport service. The system protocol uses two different transport services: a reliable, connection-oriented service and a reliable, FIFO ordered multicast service. A prototype of GMS has been implemented on a Unix platform and a number of performance tests and evaluations have been performed. The results showed that the GMS approach to group and session management is feasible and that the system can easily be used by designers of group communication systems. However, the prototype implementation has some performance drawbacks, for which possible solutions are also suggested."

    abstract =  "The developments in information technology of the last years have led to major advances in high-speed networking, multimedia capabilities for workstations and also distributed multimedia applications. In particular, multimedia applications for computer supported cooperative work have been developed that allow groups of people to exchange information and to collaborate and cooperate joint work. However, existing communication systems do not provide end-to-end guarantees for multipoint communication services which are needed by these applications. In this thesis, a communication architecture is described that offers end-to-end performance guarantees in conjunction with flexible multipoint communication services. The architecture is implemented in the Multipoint Communication Framework (MCF) that extends the basic communication services of existing operating systems. It orchestrates endsystem and network resources in order to provide end-to-end performance guarantees. Furthermore, it provides multipoint communication services where participants dynamically join and leave. The communication services are implemented by protocol stacks which form a three layer hierarchy. The topmost layer is called multimedia support layer. It accesses the endsystem's multimedia devices. The transport layer implements end-to-end protocol functions that are used to forward multimedia data. The lowest layer is labelled multicast adaptation layer. It interfaces to various networks and provides a multipoint-to-multipoint communication service that is used by the transport layer. Each layer contains a set of modules that implement a single protocol function. Protocol stacks are dynamically composed out of modules. Each protocol uses a single module on each layer. Applications specify their service requirements as Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. MCF maps these QoS parameters to the above mentioned layers, where they are used to calculate the needed resources. A resource manager reserves memory, CPU and multimedia devices in the endsystem. Access to the CPU is provided by a real-time scheduler for periodic tasks, which executes the protocols. The reservation of network resources is delegated to the network resource manager. MCF orchestrates endsystem and network resources in order to provide a guaranteed service covering the whole path from multimedia device to multimedia device. The evaluation of MCF shows that the proposed architecture results in an easy to use and efficient solution. The dynamic composition of protocol stacks offers high flexibility and allows applications to transport any multimedia data over any network. Resource reservations provide the performance guarantees needed for continuous media such as audio or video."

    abstract =  {The rise and success of the modern science, first in physics, later in biology and medicine, was based on a mechanic-linear model of causality. Its only category of explanation of natural processes is the mechanical machine. Such a point of view is reductionistic and does not justice to living organisms. As human beings using and processing signs we cannot recognize ourselves in this model. As all living creatures we perceive, interpret and answer the stimuli of the environment. To explain the behavior of organisms we need a semiotic-circular causality. Semiotics, the study of signs, try to perceive and interpret processes of signs. Language serves as a paradigmatic model. Semiotics can be subdivided in semantics, the theory of meaning, in syntax, the theory of the forms and the arrangement of the signs, and in pragmatics, the theory of the contextual rules of communication. Pragmatics as a subject of inquiry in its own right attained its scientific status in the last few decades only. Semiotics are not concerned exclusively with language, but help as so-called "biosemiotics" also to explain the network of communication on and between the different levels of organisation of molecules, cells, organs or organism. Living organisms are networks connecting these levels with each other and with the environment. The Denkstil of established pharmacology is likewise restricted to mechanic causality. Phenomena unexplained by physics are classified as unscientific. As a consequence the placebo effect is defined as 'non-specific' or 'non-characteristic'. Such negative definitions exclude concrete questions of investigation. If we accept a biosemotic view in pharmacology, that is to say that we see drugs as signs consisting of a physical vehicle equipped with meaning, then the lock-and-key-concept becomes the syntactic level and the effect on the metabolism of the cell mediated by second messengers, on the organ and on the organism becomes the semantic level. The establishment of structure-effect-relations are the only goal of the classic pharmacology, just as syntax and semantics are the only domain of the classic semiotics. But the therapy with drugs must be seen in a broader treatment context. One has to include the level of the organism of the doctor-patient-relation or the placebo effect and of the internal organismic system levels as individual response to a drug, dependent on the genetic idiosyncrasy, the environment of the cell, the recent past, the thermodynamic activity etc. The assumption of steady state conditions are unrealistically restrictive. The semiotic expansion of the pharmacology will not invalidate the achievements of classic pharmacology, but elucidates in addition a view of the pragmatic components and makes the scientific integration of the placebo phenomenon into the drug therapy possible. The placebo effect looses its inconsistency. From a biosemiotic point of view the randomized placebo controlled double blind trial must be seen as a restriction to unrealistic conditions of investigation. The pragmatic regularities and thus a scientific approach to the processes happening within the therapeutic triangle of therapist, drug and patient are excluded. The comparison of a drug with a placebo is a category-mistake. By comparing semantics with pragmatics, the investigator confounds the levels of analysis. A semiotic pharmacology expanded by pragmatics increases the number of aspects of the therapeutical situation. Pharmacology ought to pay more attention to pragmatic aspects of drug therapy.}

    abstract =  "While there have been dramatic increases in the use of digital technologies for information storage, processing and delivery over the last twenty years, the affordances of paper have ensured its retention as a key information medium. Despite predictions of the paperless office, paper is ever more present in our daily work as reflected by the continuously increasing worldwide paper consumption. Many researchers have argued for the retention of paper as an information resource and its integration into cross-media environments as opposed to its replacement. This has resulted in a wide variety of projects and technological developments for digitally augmented paper documents over the past decade. However, the majority of the realised projects focus on technical advances in terms of hardware but pay less attention to the very fundamental information integration and cross-media information management issues. Our information-centric approach for a tight integration of paper and digital information is based on extending an object-oriented database management system with functionality for cross-media information management. The resulting iServer platform introduces fundamental link concepts at an abstract level. The iServer's core link management functionality is available across different multimedia resources. Only the media-specific portion of these general concepts, for example the specification of a link's source anchor, has to be implemented in the form of a plug-in to support new resource types. This resource plug-in mechanism results in a flexible and extensible system where new types of digital as well as physical resources can easily be integrated and, more importantly, cross-linked to the growing set of supported multimedia resources. In addition to the associative linking of information, our solution allows for the integration of semantic metadata and supports multiple classification of information units. iServer can, not only link between various static information entities, but also link to active content and this has proven to be very effective in enabling more complex interaction design. As part of the European project Paper++, under the Disappearing Computer Programme, an iServer plug-in for interactive paper has been implemented to fully integrate paper and digital media, thereby gaining the best of the physical and the digital worlds. It not only supports linking from physical paper to digital information, but also enables links from digital content to physical paper or even paper to paper links. This multi-mode user interface results in highly interactive systems where users can easily switch back and forth between paper and digital information. The definition of an abstract input device interface further provides flexibility for supporting emerging technologies for paper link definition in addition to the hardware solutions for paper link definition and activation that were developed within the Paper++ project. We introduce different approaches for cross-media information authoring where information is either compiled by established publishers with an expertise in a specific domain or by individuals who produce their own cross-media information environments. Preauthored information can be combined with personally aggregated information. A distributed peer-to-peer version of the iServer platform supports collaborative authoring and the sharing of link knowledge within a community of users. The associations between different types of resources as well as other application-specific information can be visualised on different output channels. Universal access to the iServer's information space is granted using the eXtensible Information Management Architecture (XIMA), our publishing platform for multi-channel access. Our fundamental concepts for interactive paper and cross-media information management have been designed independently of particular hardware solutions and modes of interaction which enables the iServer platform to easily adapt to both new technologies and applications. Finally, the information infrastructure that we have developed has great potential as an experimental platform for the investigation of emerging multimedia resources in general and interactive paper with its possible applications in particular."

As historical discourse shifts its emphases and new aspects of the past come to be considered significant, periods and events are subject to constant change.

    abstract =  "This thesis is a contribution to the academic literature regarding post-trade activities in the foreign exchange market. The international foreign exchange market is the largest market in the world. Its volume is six times the trading volume of the second largest market, the U.S. Treasury securities market. Since there are always two parties to each foreign exchange transaction, the volume to be settled is even twice the trading volume. In foreign exchange trading, it is not uncommon for two banks to owe each other 2 billion US Dollar overnight because settlement has not yet been completed. The figures make clear that reliability and resilience of the settlement processes are essential. Interruptions or delays may have disastrous consequences for the financial industry. During the past years, financial authorities have started to realize the system's vulnerability and increasingly paid attention to post trade activities in general and to settlement practices of foreign exchange in particular. In the nineties, several publications have highlighted that most banks had tremendous overnight credit risk exposures due to current settlement and reconciliation practices at that time. Regulators called on the financial industry to take appropriate action to measure and reduce the settlement risks in the foreign exchange market. Since then, the international financial industry has heavily invested in operations and technology to comply with regulators' requests. The most important result from these common industry efforts is the implementation of the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system. Briefly, CLS is specifically designed to eliminate credit risk on foreign exchange transactions that it settles. A payment-versus-payment settlement mechanism combined with a number of risk management provisions eliminates credit risk exposures. The elimination of credit risk, however, brought a number of other changes to the market. This thesis deals with the most important aspects of the CLS system in general and its implications for the market. It provides an in depth description of CLS's functionality, documents the history of its implementation, and looks into its transaction structure. The goal of this thesis can thus be split in four parts: (1) Provide a description of CLS' history, (2) deliver an in depth description of its functionality, (3) assess CLS's achievement in reducing credit risk, and (4) analyze the evolvement of its transaction structure and pick up some liquidity issues. These four parts together form a comprehensive overview of the CLS system. It must be mentioned that this thesis does not explicitly focus on operational risks or corporate governance issues nor on systemic risk aspects. They may be a component part of the thesis but are not addressed separately. The thesis concludes that CLS is a success story. Once running, the system proved its resilience and was able to successfully penetrate the market. Around 60 percent of global foreign exchange turnover is estimated to be settled in CLS. If this equals a 60 percent credit risk reduction, the urge of the Bank for International Settlements may be considered to be well fulfilled. The empirical part of the thesis offers insights into the trading structure among CLS members. Substantial differences in the structure of settlement member and third party relationships were found. Settlement members are highly connected among each other and do not show significant changes over time. The connectivity of third parties is much lower and shows the development of power law characteristics. Statistics and visualized network graphs suggest that new third parties tend to be smaller than the existing ones. This means that a relatively small group of members generates an increasing part of the business. In terms of liquidity, the analysis was based on the bilateral net sell position. The fact that these positions did in average not lower during the past years, indicates that simply increasing the number of members does not automatically lead to lower bilateral net sell positions. In contrast, cross sectional regression suggests that there is a certain dependency between the level of the bilateral net sell position and the type of trade relation. It seems that trade relations between members with high relative connectivity lead to lower bilateral net sell positions. If and how these results may be implemented in a practical context is yet unclear."

    abstract =  "Biometric methods for verifying, i.e. authenticating, someone's identity are increasingly being used. Today's commercially available biometric systems show good reliability. However, they generally lack user acceptance. Users show an antipathy touching a fingerprint scanner and they dislike looking into an iris scanner that might eventually malfunction and impair their vision. In general, they favour systems with the least amount of interaction. Using gait as a biometric feature would lessen such problems since it requires no subject interaction other than walking by. Consequently, this would increase user acceptance. And since highly motivated users achieve higher recognition scores, it increases the overall recognition rate as well. This monograph describes a biometric system that uses individual characteristics of human gait for authentication. Two sensors measuring different physical properties of the walking person were used. First, a force sensor measures the Ground Reaction Force (GRF) perpendicular to the floor and second, a video sensor captures a side view of the passing person. Computationally efficient algorithms were developed to extract five different feature types, i.e. modalities, from the acquired gait data. A novel variant of the Generalised Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) was devised to reduce data dimensionality without losing, or even better, with improving person separability. Last but not least, a Bayes Risk Criterion approach is used to fuse the five modalities. In the final investigation the performance and discriminatory power of all modalities was analysed. In addition, the influence of changing clothes, shoes, backpacks, and bags on the recognition quality was investigated. It could be shown that fusing all five modalities drastically improves the overall system robustness compared to the best individual modality. Finally, an extensive discussion of the limitations and possible future improvements of the current system is included."

    abstract =  {Due to technological changes in cartography, traditional paper atlases have increasingly been replaced by digital atlas information systems (AIS) during the last 20 years. AIS offer both user-friendly interfaces and high-quality multimedia visualisation techniques, yet they still lack the functionality to perform spatial analysis. This functionality, however, offers a great potential for the future development of AIS. Therefore, this dissertation investigates how GIS analysis functions can be integrated with AIS, and how these functions can be rendered accessible to a broad range of expert and non-expert users. The emphasis of this dissertation is placed on using environmental vector data sets within AIS. In the theoretical first part of the study, a new scientific approach called "GIS analysis in atlas information systems" was developed. This approach first points out that the following GIS functions are suited for AIS: measurements, queries, reclassification and aggregation, graphical and geometrical overlay, analysis of surfaces, network analysis and statistics. Since analysis of surfaces is usually not based on a vector model, it cannot be considered for AIS with environmental vector data sets. Secondly, the approach states that these GIS functions have to be easy to use, reliable (i. e., ensuring correct results), data independent and fast (i. e., performed within a short time) in order to be successful in AIS. These requirements, however, can only be met if the technical structure of the AIS is flexible enough to allow authors to individually design and develop the graphical user interface and the GIS functions. In the practical second part of the study, the scientific approach was realised by developing the application AGAIS (Analytical Geographic Atlas Information System). As examples of environmental vector data sets, the digital soil-suitability and precipitation maps of Switzerland were used. The graphical user interface was developed using the multimedia authoring system Macromedia Director, while the GIS functions were programmed with an external shared library written in C++. In accordance to the scientific approach, only those functions were implemented in AGAIS that are suited for AIS with environmental vector data and make sense for the soil-suitability and precipitation maps. The GIS functions were adapted in such a way as to meet the requirements of users not having any GIS technical knowledge. Thus, using AGAIS, it is possible to perform complex queries and reclassification without knowing the syntax of a query language. In addition, these functions ensure correct results. When two map layers are graphically overlaid, map elements can easily be compared with the two-dimensional, likewise overlaid legend. The geometrical overlay is rendered transparent to the users by progressively drawing the intersection points and the newly built polygons on the map. In so doing, users gain insight into the process of a complex GIS function. Moreover, they get the impression of a shorter waiting time. Finally, when users perform statistical analysis, they can at a glance identify the distribution and correlation pattern of attributes in coloured diagrams. This study shows that GIS functions can be successfully integrated with AIS. These functions, however, must be carefully chosen, considerably adapted, and simplified so that atlas users can understand them by intuition. Therefore, the functions and the user interface cannot be adopted from common GIS, but have to be redesigned according to the needs of atlas users. In future, integrating GIS functionality will positively influence the development of AIS and will extend their field of application. Complex spatial analysis, so far mainly performed by GIS specialists, is now available to a broader range of users. Although AIS will become more analytical in the future, they are not likely to grow together with GIS. On the contrary, they will remain independent and closed systems.}

    abstract =  "A detailed experimental and numerical study of three-dimensional laminar flow over a backward-facing step with an expansion ratio of 2 and a downstream aspect ratio of 20 is presented. Experimental results for transitional and turbulent flow are also reported. Experiments were based on both Digital and Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry; a spectral element method was used for the simulations. The focus of the present work was two-fold: (i) A passive control scheme for inducing global unsteadiness, suggested in previous work, was implemented, and the controlled flow was studied in the laminar and turbulent regimes. (ii) In the uncontrolled flow, the effects of sidewalls on the flow structure were studied at laminar, transitional, and turbulent Reynolds number values. The control scheme consisted of external flow recirculation due to suction at the step wall and blowing at the lower wall. The problem geometry was fixed and, thus, for a given Reynolds number, the flow dynamics depended only on the recirculation volume flow rate. For laminar flow, periodic vortex shedding from the step edge was observed within a range of recirculation flow rates, both in experiments and two-dimensional simulations. Global stability analysis calculations support the present simulation results. The experimental laminar flow was found to be strongly three-dimensional, exhibiting streamwise vortices in the shear layer regions. For turbulent flow, the present control scheme significantly increased mixing in the region immediately after the sudden expansion. This led to a decrease in reattachment length of the order of 70\% in comparison to the non-manipulated flow. The control scheme was found to be robust to variations in the suction/blowing velocity boundary conditions. In the present study of sidewall effects, both experimental and computational results illustrated that, for laminar flow, a wall-jet is present at the channel lower wall, directed towards the channel mid-plane, in agreement with previous observations. In the present work, the development of self-similar wall-jet profiles with increasing distance from the sidewalls is demonstrated. The intensity of this secondary flow increased with Reynolds number in the laminar regime, and decreased in the transitional and turbulent regimes. The effect of sidewalls on the primary and upper wall recirculation zones is demonstrated, which explains the discrepancies in the previous literature between experiments and two-dimensional simulations."

    abstract =  "Non-temporal data models and their implementations as database management systems (DBMS) capture a single state of the real world, usually the current one. They support modification operations which facilitate the transition from one consistent database state to another. For queries, they assume that the data is synchronous, meaning that all the facts stored in the database are valid at the time instant a query is evaluated. There exist many application domains, however, where it is necessary to reconstruct earlier database states or even store future database states (e. g. for planning, budgets) in parallel. The different database states are stored as temporal data. Such temporal data arises, for example, in financial and insurance applications, in reservation systems and in medical information management. Of course, it is also possible in practice to store timestamps in classical DBMS and model the temporal aspects mentioned above in this way. However, such an approach does not cater for the special semantics of time. Thus, there are many proposals for both relational and object-oriented models as to how the non-temporal data models can be enhanced to support the management of temporal data. Their focus is mainly on extending the data structures and/or the query language. Hardly any of these temporal data models were implemented, even in the form of prototype systems. A more systematic way to define temporal data models is based on generalising a non-temporal data model into a temporal one. Using generalisation means that all constructs of the underlying non-temporal data model --- its data structures, operations and integrity constraints --- are enhanced to support the management of time-varying data. To show the power of the generalisation approach, this thesis investigates three approaches to managing temporal data, along with the corresponding prototype implementations. The first approach timestamps data by extending the data structures with special timestamp attributes, but, in contrast to existing proposals, uses a generalised query, data definition and data manipulation language. The second approach fully generalises a non-temporal object data model into a temporal one. The resulting temporal object data model TOM does not extend the data structures, but rather uses the notion of temporal object identifiers to timestamp data. In TOM, not only the user data can be timestamped, but also constructs supported by the data model such as collections of objects, types, integrity constraints and so on, since they are also considered to be objects. This temporal data model was implemented as a single-user prototype system. The third approach demonstrates how the extensible nature of object-oriented DBMS can be used directly to support temporal applications through the use of abstract data types. It is shown that while temporal data structures and operations can be accommodated in this way, support for generalised data models and query languages is restricted. These approaches show that a generalised temporal data model is better suited to the modeling and management of temporal data than an extended one, and that generalised data models are implementable. By presenting an evolutionary path from temporal first normal form relations to temporal nested relations, temporal complex objects and temporal object-oriented data models, it is shown that the temporal object data model TOM actually subsumes the extended temporal data models."

    abstract =  "The coda of seismic waves consists of that part of the signal after the directly arriving phases. In a finite medium, or in one that is strongly heterogeneous, the coda is dominated by waves which have repeatedly sampled the medium. Small changes in a medium which may have no detectable influence on the first arrivals are amplified by this repeated sampling and may thus be detectable in the coda. We refer to this use of multiple-sampling coda waveforms as coda wave interferometry. We have exploited ultrasonic coda waves to monitor time- varying rock-properties in a laboratory environment. We have studied the dependence of velocity on uni-axial stress in Berea sandstone, the temperature dependence of velocity in granite and in aluminum, and the change in velocity due to an increase of water saturation in sandstone. Furthermore, We applied coda wave interferometry to seismic data excited by a hammer source, collected at an experimental hard rock mine, Idaho Springs, CO. We carried out a controlled stress-change experiment in a pillar and we were able to monitor the internal stress change. We used coda wave interferometry to monitor temporal changes in the subsurface of the Mt. Erebus Volcano, Antarctica. Mt. Erebus is one of the few volcanoes known to have a convecting lava lake. The convection provides a repeating seismic source producing seismic energy that propagates through the strongly scattering geology in the volcano. There are many other possible applications of coda wave interferometry in geophysics, including dam and nuclear waste deposit monitoring, time-lapse reservoir characterization, earthquake relocation, stress monitoring in surface mining and rock physics."

    abstract =  {Economic development relies crucially on natural resources and on the productivity of natural Systems. Economic actors, however, do not have to pay for these production factors because most of the environmental benefits natural resources provide are not marketed and therefore do not command market price. Does accounting for ecosystem goods and Services (ES) in landscape planning help secure long-term economic benefits? Within several building blocks, the value of ES for the regional economy of a mountainous region --- the Landschaft Davos (Grisons, Switzerland) --- is studied, and a framework to account for ES in landscape planning is suggested. In a first step, a study was designed focusing on the valuation of an important ecosystem Service for a tourism region, namely scenic beauty (Paper I). A prototypical technique to predict preferences for views using GIS (Geographic Information System)-based variables was developed. Data on scenic preferences for landscape changes were gathered using a web-based survey. The relationship between the portion of the field of view, which was taken by different land-uses changes were found to be correlated with the willingness-to-pay responses, and was used to predict changes in scenic values for another view in the region. In a second step, a GIS modeling platform was developed to value changes in the Provision of a set of selected ES (Paper II). We compared the impacts of a human development scenario and a climate scenario on the ES values. The framework helped quantify and visualize the negative impacts of urban expansion and tourist infrastructure developments on scenic beauty and habitats. We showed that forest expansion, predictable under a climate change scenario, favors natural avalanche protection and habitats, and that the loss of ES due to new tourist infrastructures diminished the benefits of the development by 70\%. Yet, the framework suggested in Paper II did not include the explicit quantification of the uncertainties related to the quantification and valuation procedure. Especially the use of monetary valuation is known to be associated with many uncertainties,which we discussed in Paper I. Bayesian networks (BN) are know to facilitate the explicit modeling of the involved uncertainties in a probabilistic framework. As natural protection from avalanches was identified as an important ES in the case study region, we linked a BN to a GIS for avalanche risk assessment (Paper III). The study showed that such an approach allows quantifying and visualizing uncertainties in a spatially explicit manner. We could map areas with high uncertainties, located at the border of the avalanche run-out areas, and identify the variables responsible for these uncertainties.While avalanche pressure was identified as having a large influence on the cost values, we applied a Bayesian inference to determine a probabilistic model of the variables influencing the calculated avalanche pressure using observations of past avalanches (Paper IV). Applied to the avalanche risk assessment in Paper III, we found a difference of a factor of two when comparing the resulting annual risks to that calculated using the traditional semi-empirical avalanche hazard model. The question of the contribution of the value of ES to the regional economy was addressed by integrating the regionally valued ES on the supply side of an Input- Output Table (Paper V). Using several different indicators based on this IOT, we discussed the benefits of the ES for regional development. While the considered ES "avalanche protection","carbon Sequestration", and "wood production" added only 2\% to the annual regional production volume, the model helped identify which economic sectors benefit most from the use of ES and how important they are for different industries. We showed that, if we abandon using the landscape for economic production, it loses its value not only for the industry formerly using the land (e.g. agriculture), but also for the entire regional production and supply chains linked with this industry. To counteract this effect, we demonstrated that the use of ES had to be intensified: Economic activities should encourage using the ES more intensively, while landscape development should aim at providing the required Services. Based on the knowledge acquired in the first five papers, we addressed the question of the significance of accounting for ES values in landscape planning (Paper VI). We showed that by linking a BN with a GIS, we could identify optimal locations for new settlement areas in regard to impacts to ES. A large part of the optimal areas matched already existing plans to expand the golf course at the entry of the Dischma Valley. The BN allowed explicitly addressing the uncertainties at all levels of the quantification and valuation procedure, and supported a structured approach to the interdisciplinary task requiring information from different specialist fields. While the value of the ES diminished the benefits of a new settlement area by just 30% in 2050, we showed that their relative impact increased in the long-term: If preferences for preserving ES are low nowadays, the expected benefits of a settlement expansion decrease significantly. Thus, incorporating ES values in planning will not bring about sustainability unless each generation is committed to transferring to the next sufficient natural resources to make development sustainable. Considering the importance of the explicit consideration of the uncertainties in the quantification and valuation of ES, BN linked to a GIS are supportive for presenting credible information to planners in a spatially explicit manner. The approach allows unifying human expertise and quantitative knowledge in a coherent framework, which overcomes a major limitation of previous approaches. While the GIS-based flexible framework allows integrating additional ES and different valuation data, more research needs to be conducted to investigate the transferability of such an approach to other areas providing other ES.}

    abstract =  {Communication networks lend themselves to the study of a variety of optimization problems. A fundamental problem among them that is intensively investigated is that of call admission control, or call control for short. The problem arises in the following setting. The communication network consists of nodes (e.g. terminals, routers, et cetera) which are connected to each other via links (e.g. optical cables). These links carry data between nodes. They have a certain bandwidth capacity associated with them. A call is a communication request between any two nodes of the network. It is associated with a bandwidth requirement, i.e. the rate at which data is communicated between the nodes. A call may be accepted into the network if (i) a route connecting the two nodes exists and (ii) the bandwidth requirement of the call can be reserved along all the links of one such route. Once a call is accepted a profit is accrued by the network. The optimization problem arises due to the fact that the sum of the bandwidth requirements of calls that are routed through any link of the network should not exceed its bandwidth capacity. The call control problem is to maximize the number (or profits) of calls that can be accepted into the network such that the capacity constraints on the links are not violated. A ring topology is one in which the nodes are connected to each other forming a cycle. In all-optical networks, the ring topology is a popular configuration. Bigger networks are formed from individual rings by interconnecting them. Some top reasons that make the ring topology a favoured one are its simplicity, scalability and survivability in the presence of link failures. This thesis mainly investigates several variants of call control on ring based topologies for two reasons. Firstly, all-optical networks are in the forefront of revolutionizing communications today and the ring topology is the building block of such networks. Secondly, rings are simple topologies on which several network optimization problems have been studied in the past and there are several others which have not been resolved. The goal of our research, the outcome of which is the thesis presented here, is to address a few such problems pertaining to call control. There are two basic variants of call control that we consider, namely on- line and off-line. In the off-line version of call control, it is assumed that all the calls that occur in the network are given in advance. An algorithm for this version can decide which calls to accept and which to reject taking this overall picture into consideration. In the online version, calls arrive into the network in a sequence, one after the other. An algorithm for the on-line version makes a decision to accept a call that is presented to it only based on what decisions it made in the past and the current state of the network. In particular, it has no knowledge of the calls that might be presented to it in the future. A tree of rings is a graph obtained by connecting several disjoint rings in a "tree"-like fashion, by identifying vertices in different rings. The tree of rings topology is a natural result of interconnecting rings in all-optical networks to form larger networks. We investigate on-line call control problems on trees of rings. Non-preemptive randomized algorithms with competitive ratios that are best possible up to constant factors are given. Fixed parameter tractability is an emerging area to tackle NP-hard problems. We view call control problems from this perspective. Fixed parameter tractability results are shown for variants of the off-line call control problems on arbitrary graphs, undirected and bidirected trees of rings. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such results for the call control problem. For two variants of off-line call control problems in rings, we present polynomial time approximation algorithms. When the route of a call can be determined by the algorithm, we present an algorithm that accepts and routes at most 3 calls fewer than what an optimal algorithm can achieve. When the routes are pre-determined we present an algorithm that achieves a profit that is at least one-half of that achieved by an optimal algorithm. For various special cases, we present optimal polynomial time algorithms or approximation schemes. We also give an indication of the difficulty of finding an optimal polynomial algorithm for the general problem. For addressing the off-line call control problem for calls with arbitrary bandwidth requirements, a starting point would be to study it on the simple topology of a line. A line is simply a set of nodes connected to form a path. We identify several restrictions for which algorithms with "nice" ratios are achievable.}

    abstract =  {Cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy, are the principal cause of mortality in industrialized countries. Chronic inflammatory processes are of major importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease and myocarditis. Initial injury is likely to be elicited by infectious agents that can sustain chronic immune responses and immunopathology by persisting in the cardiovascular system. Such chronic infections may eventually overcome tolerance and induce reactivity against self-antigens with exacerbation of the disease. Indeed, autoimmune reactions have been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and atherosclerosis. To shed light on the mechanisms behind chronic cardiovascular diseases, we used a transgenic mouse model in which autoimmunity can be specifically elicited in the heart and the aorta (SM-LacZ mice). The two first studies deal with the role and significance of B cells and their accompanying autoantibody signatures in systemic and heart-specific autoimmunity, respectively. The third and the fourth sections describe how virus elicited CD8+ T cells can either be exhausted and functionally impaired in conditions of high antigen expression in the periphery, or lead to the exacerbation of atherosclerosis and chronic immunopatholgy in a model of antigen persistence in the cardiovascular system. In the first part of this work we present a preliminary investigation on the autoimmune B cell response engendered following infection with cytopathic (vaccinia virus, VV and vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV) or non-cytopathic (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCMV) viruses. Applying the SEREX method (serological identification of recombinantly expressed antigens), we show that viruses induce antibodies against a broad panel of autoantigens. Furthermore, the different viruses triggered distinct autoantibody responses, thus suggesting that virus infections may leave specific "autoantibody fingerprints" in the infected host. The second chapter is dedicated to the characterization of the anti-self IgG response in organ-specific autoimmunity. Here the SEREX approach was used to molecularly dissect heart-specific autoimmune B cell responses that develop during the course of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). Upon immunization with a peptide derived from cardiac myosin heavy chain $\alpha$ (myhc$\alpha$) we found that the vast majority of the autoantibodies generated in BALB/c mice was specific for portions of the myosin protein that did not encompass the immunogenic peptide, hence revealing intramolecular epitope spreading. This strong focusing on myhc$\alpha$ was also a hallmark of the B cell response against heart antigens, that was induced upon myocardial damage following MCMV infection which generally precipitates a broad spectrum of anti-self antibodies. Furthermore, myocarditis severity correlated with both intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading. Therefore, evaluation of the focusing of an antibody response to disease-related self-determinants may help to assess both the susceptibility to and the progression rate of autoimmune cardiac damage. The third study investigates the fate of transgene-specific CD8+ T cells following abortive infection with a recombinant adenovirus. We found that specific CD8+ T cells expanded only in a very narrow dose range and that they were functionally impaired. Infection of SM-LacZ mice led to the deletion of these specific CD8+ T cells and, consequently, transgenic mice did not develop myocarditis. Our results suggest that the outcome of vaccination with recombinant adenoviruses is critically dependent on the antigen load in peripheral tissues. The last chapter is an immunologic analysis of the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis in an infectious situation. Although hypercholesterolemic APOE(-/-) and APOE(-/-)$\times$SM-LacZ mice mounted comparable T cell responses to a recombinant MCMV-LacZ virus, persistent expression of the $\beta$galactosidase transgene in the vasculature, as it occurs in APOE(-/-)$\times$SM-LacZ mice, dramatically exacerbated atherosclerosis and elicited chronic cellular infiltrations in the aorta. Therefore, our data provide evidence for the role of persistent vascular infections with pathogens and the ensuing specific immunopathology in atherogenic processes.}

    abstract =  "In this thesis we elaborate a language description formalism called Montages. The Montages formalism can be used to engineer domain specific languages (DSLs), which are computer languages specially tailored and typically restricted to solve problems of specific domains. We focus on DSLs which have some algorithmic flavor and are intended to be used in corporate environments where main-stream state-based programming and modeling formalisms1 prevail. For engineering such DSLs it is important that the designs of the existing, well known general purpose languages (GPLs) can be described as well, and that this descriptions are easily reused as basic building blocks to design new DSLs. Using the Montages tool support Gem-Mex, such a new designs can be composed in an integrated semantics environment, and from the descriptions an interpreter and a specialized visual debugger is generated for the new language. We restrict our research to sequential languages and the technical part of the thesis tries to contribute to the improvement of the DSL design process by focusing on ease of specification and ease of reuse for programming language constructs from well known GPL designs. For the sake of shortness we do not present detailed case studies for DSLs and refer the reader to the literature. Finally, we mainly look at exact reuse of specification modules, and we have not elaborated the means for incremental design by reusing specifications in the sense of object oriented programming. Of course these means are needed as well and we assume the existence of such reuse features without formalizing them. The technical part of the thesis provides the basic specification patterns for introducing all features of an object oriented style of reuse, and applying these patterns to Montages in order to make it an object-oriented specification formalism is left for future work. The focus and contribution of this thesis is the design and elaboration of a language engineering discipline based on widely-spread state-based intuition of algorithms and programming. This approach opens the possibility to apply DSL technology in typical corporate environments, where the beneficial properties of smaller, and therefore by nature more secure and more focused computer languages are most leveraged. The thesis does not cover the equally important topic how to formalize these beneficial properties by means of declarative formalisms and how to apply mechanized reasoning and formal software engineering to DSLs. The thesis is structured in three parts. In the first part the requirements for a language engineering approach are analyzed and the language definition formalism Montages is introduced. In the second part the formal semantics and system architecture of Montages is given. The third part consists of a number of small example languages, each of them designed to show the Montages solution for specifying a well-known feature of main-stream object oriented programming languages such as Java. The single description modules of these example languages can be used to assemble a full object-oriented language, or a small subset of them can be combined with some high-level domain-specific features into a DSL. In the following we summarize for each part and its chapters their content and relation to each other."

Networks of these untethered devices can be deployed unobtrusively in the physical environment in order to monitor a wide variety of real-world phenomena with unprecedented quality and scale while only marginally disturbing the observed physical processes. Due to the close integration of sensor networks with the real world, the categories time and location are fundamental for many applications of sensor networks, for example to interpret sensing results (e.g., where and when did an event occur) or for coordination among sensor nodes (e.g., which nodes can when be switched to idle mode). Hence, time synchronization and sensor node localization are fundamental and closely related services in sensor networks. Existing solutions for these two basic services have been based on a rather narrow notion of a sensor network as a large-scale, ad hoc, multi-hop, unpartitioned network of largely homogeneous, tiny, resource-constrained, mostly immobile sensor nodes that would be randomly deployed in the area of interest. However, recently developed prototypical applications indicate that this narrow definition does not cover a significant portion of the application domain of wireless sensor networks. Our thesis is that applications of sensor networks span a whole design space with many important dimensions. Existing solutions for time synchronization and node localization do not cover important parts of this design space. Substantially different approaches are required to support these regions adequately. Such solutions can actually be provided. We support this thesis by proposing a design space of wireless sensor networks where concrete applications can be located at different points of the space. We identify two important regions in the design space that are not appropriately supported by existing methods for time synchronization and node localization. We also propose, implement, and evaluate new solutions that cover these regions. The practical feasibility of our approaches is demonstrated by means of a typical sensor network application which requires time synchronization and node localization. Our approach to time synchronization supports applications where network connectivity is intermittent. The idea underlying our Time-Stamp Synchronization method is to avoid proactive synchronization of the clocks of all nodes in a network. Instead, the clocks of the sensor nodes run unsynchronized, each defining its own local time scale. Only if clock readings are exchanged among nodes as time stamps contained in network messages, these time stamps are transformed from the time scale of the sender to the time scale of the receiver. This approach is scalable, since time is only synchronized on demand where and when needed by the application. The approach is also resource efficient, since it piggybacks on existing message exchanges. Our approach to node localization supports tiny sensor nodes known as Smart Dust. The Lighthouse Location System is based on a single beacon device that emits particular optical signal patterns. Sensor nodes can autonomously infer their location by passively observing these signals. This approach is scalable, since each node infers its location independent of other nodes. A single beacon device emits long-range signals in broadcast mode and can support arbitrary network densities. The approach is resource efficient, since the sensor nodes do not actively emit any signals. Only a tiny, energy-efficient optical receiver is needed to infer locations."

    abstract =  {Visions of future computing environments involve integrating tiny microelectronic processors and sensors into everyday objects in order to make them "smart." Smart things can explore their environment, communicate with other smart things, and interact with humans, therefore helping users to cope with their tasks in new, intuitive ways. However, this digitization of our everyday lives will not only allow computers to better "understand" our actions and goals, but also allow others to inspect and search such electronic records, potentially creating a comprehensive surveillance network of unprecedented scale. How should these developments affect our notion of privacy, our "right to be let alone," our freedom to determine for ourselves when, how, and to what extend information about us is communicated to others? Should we give up our solitude and anonymity in light of these new technological realities and create a "transparent society," in which nothing can be kept secret anymore, for better or for worse? Or do we need to surround ourselves with better security mechanisms that will make our communications and our presence untraceable to anyone but the most determined observer? This thesis argues for a third alternative, a middle ground between the two extremes of abandoning privacy and attempting full-scale anonymity. It proposes an architecture to facilitate the upfront notices of data collections in future computer environments, means to automatically process such announcements and individually configure the available collection parameters, processes to store and subsequently process any such collected data automatically according to the given notices, and tools for individuals to control and inspect their state of privacy in an ever connected world. In particular, this thesis provides for a method to announce privacy policies in smart environments via privacy beacons and personal privacy assistants, a method to reason and act upon such policies by automatically configuring the available services with the help of privacy proxies, and a method to store the collected information and enforce their respective collection and usage policies through privacy-aware databases. Taken together, these mechanisms can provide the technical foundations for future privacy frameworks that provide a level of privacy protection suitable for smart environments: anytime, anywhere, effortless privacy.}

    abstract =  "Currently more than 1'000'000 total knee arthroplasties, TKAs, are implanted world wide each year, thereof 40'000 TKAs in Switzerland. Because of higher life expectancies it is expected that the number of total knee implantations will increase in the next few years. The goals of a TKA are longevity of the implant components and high satisfactory patient rates. Today the rate of a good patient outcome is around 85\%, which still leaves a significant absolute number of patients needing early revision surgery. The most common causes for revision surgery are polyethylene (PE) wear, loosening, knee instability and infection. PE wear, loosening and instability are factors associated with altered joint biomechanics after total knee replacement. The femoral component rotational alignment profoundly affects the knee joint's mechanics in flexion as well as in extension, in all six degrees of freedom. A malrotated femoral component could lead to ligament unbalancing causing lateral flexion instability and pain while standing up from a chair or walking down stairs. In order to avoid these problems a comprehensive mechanical understanding of the knee joint as regards to the alignment of the implant component in TKA is important. A three dimensional computer based model visualising the joint's kinematics during different motion patterns contributes to this understanding and makes it possible to estimate the load at the knee joint. Such a model requires accurate in vivo kinematic and kinetic data to visualise and calculate the load at the joint of different motion patterns of daily activities. Previous investigations in gait analysis used kinematic and kinetic information from skin mounted markers and force plates during level walking. The problem of this measurement technique is the large error in kinematic data acquisition caused by the movement of the skin and muscles relative to the underlying bone. Video-fluoroscopy enables the measurement of kinematics of implant components more accurately by a three-dimensional numeric reconstruction of the single plane projection view in the fluoroscopic images, thus avoiding skin movement artefacts. However, this technique is limited to the field of view of the fluoroscopic screen. This problem was solved by using a motor driven trolley built in the laboratory to carry the fluoroscopic unit (x-ray source, image intensifier, c-arm). This movable system allows the tracking of the knee joint during level walking, and a sit down task. An intensity based registration algorithm reconstructs the six degrees of freedom of the implant components relative to the focus of the fluoroscope. The three dimensional reconstruction is within a translational accuracy of 3.1 mm and a rotational accuracy of 1.6$^\circ$. Video-fluoroscopy only acquires kinematic data. This means that the loads in the knee joint can not be estimated. In this study was force plate data coupled with the moving fluoroscopic system enabling inverse dynamic calculation. The unit mover was optically tracked by VICON in order to transform the fluoroscopic coordinate system into the global coordinate system with its origin on the centre of one force plate, thereby coupling the fluoroscopic system with the force plate. This transformation was performed within an accuracy of $\pm$ 1 mm. This measuring system results in seven times more accurate inverse dynamic calculation than classic instrumented gait analysis would achieve. The local mechanics of the total knee was visualised in a three dimensional computer model. The model included TKA geometry from CAD software, and bone geometry from CT scans of the individual. It visualised the kinematics of the implant components during the activities mentioned above. Furthermore, femoral component malrotation was simulated to estimate the alternated strain at the posterior cruciate ligament, the medial, and the lateral collateral ligaments. The simulation of five different degrees of femoral component malrotation shows the relationship between the strain and forces produced by the ligaments under these conditions. The simulation shows that an internally rotated femoral component has a more profound effect on the forces in the ligaments than an external rotational malalignment. This might lead to pain on the medial side and condylar lift-off on the lateral side during a sit down task, as observed by clinicians. This work sets a basis for further investigation of TKA discussing the patient's outcome and contributing to a better mechanical understanding of the knee joint. It may help clinicians and implant developers discuss the effects of their implant design or alignment of the implant components under dynamic loading."

    abstract =  "The recent rise and widespread adoption of wireless networking technologies for mobile communication applications has sparked numerous visions of an ever more networked and interactive world. One such vision proposed in the late nineties are Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), where wireless communication and computing elements are combined with integrated sensors to enable tightly coupled interaction with the physical world. As a new application domain for wireless technology, key challenges here are (i) the limited resources of the highly integrated nodes that are to be leveraged by the amount of devices deployed and the collaboration between them, (ii) the tight coupling of application, nodes and the environment and (iii) the broad usage profile by systems-experts and non-expert users alike. First medium-scale experiments and field-trials have reported that it is increasingly hard to design, develop, deploy, test and validate systems consisting of more than a hand-full of nodes, especially when situated in a real-world environment. Prototypical applications are scarce, seldom consisting of more than a few tens to a hundred nodes. Setting up large, heterogeneous, interactive and functional systems as forecast in the visions is no small task; currently more an art than a systematic engineering effort. Coordinated methods and tools for the design and deployment of wireless networked embedded systems are missing today. With this work, we contribute to the design and development of wireless networked embedded systems. The specific contributions are presented and discussed in the context of a vertical slice of the design space concerned and the relevant questions encountered: (i) Functional and qualitative requirements of a location management service for WSNs based on measurements and simulation have been developed. We present one of the earliest algorithms for the distributed computation of node location. (ii) A novel platform for fast-prototyping of WSNs has been developed. This platform has successfully served numerous researchers, among ourselves, as an underlying infrastructure for experimentation and education. (iii) The BTnode platform has been used to develop multihop networks and topology control mechanisms for Bluetooth scatternets. To our knowledge, the experiments presented are the largest connected Bluetooth scatternets reported of to date. (iv) The concept of a deployment-support network as a powerful tool for the development, deployment, test and validation of WSNs is presented in conjunction with experimental evidence on the feasibility of the approach."

    abstract =  "In this thesis, we make a case for the use of guaranteed intervals for time synchronization in mobile ad-hoc networks. In particular, we look at wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a specific class of mobile ad-hoc networks. WSNs are envisioned to comprise a large number of small, inexpensive devices that operate on a very constrained energy budget. Time synchronization is an important service in WSNs. Approaches developed in the distributed-systems field typically cannot be applied directly because of the limiting characteristics of WSNs: (a) There is no guarantee of stable connectivity between nodes. (b) Energy is a very scarce resource. Communication, which is needed to achieve and maintain synchronization, is expensive in terms of energy and hence has to be kept short. (c) Communication bandwidth is limited. (d) There is no a-priori configuration or infrastructure. In particular, there are few or even no reference clocks available. In this thesis, we make a number of contributions to the state of the art in the field of time synchronization for mobile ad-hoc networks. Our main claim is that interval-based time synchronization is particularly suited for these networks. Specifically, our contributions are the following: We present a new system model for the analysis of interval-based time synchronization in mobile ad-hoc networks. We justify why our abstractions are well chosen for this class of networks. Using our system model, we derive worst-case bounds on the quality of interval-based synchronization and show the worst-case-optimality of a very simple algorithm. The simple, worst-case-optimal algorithm is not optimal in the average case. We present three algorithms that are also worst-case-optimal but achieve better synchronization quality in the average case.We show that two of the algorithms achieve optimal synchronization, albeit at the cost of high memory and communication overhead. We describe how limiting the amount of data that is stored and communicated affects the synchronization quality. We show that interval-based synchronization does not need particular communication patterns such as trees or clustered hierarchies. Hence, interval-based synchronization is resilient to mobility; our simulation results show that mobility actually improves it. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the error of gradient clock synchronization in our system model."

    abstract =  {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and affects almost 30\% of the population over 85 years of age. The cause and mechanisms of the disease are still unknown, yet a large body of evidence supports the so called amyloid cascade hypothesis. According to this model, abnormal accumulation and deposition of A$\beta$ peptide lead through a series of processes to fibril formation and synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and finally dementia. No cure for this disease is available yet and definite diagnosis is only possible by histological analysis of post mortem brain tissue. The diagnosis of a patient is a very complicated, expensive and time-consuming process including a variety of analyses such as neuropsychological testing, neuro-imaging, and blood tests. In specialized centers the accuracy of this diagnostic workup reaches 80--90\%. The aim of this study was to screen the proteome of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD, patients with other neurological disorders including other types of dementia, and healthy age-matched control subjects for differences. For the CSF proteome analysis surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) was used. This method combines a chromatographic sample prefractionation step and mass spectrometric protein analysis in one technology. The data was analyzed using classification tree software, a bio-informatics tool based on a binary recursive partitioning algorithm. A proteomic pattern for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was found consisting of 5 nodes representing peaks with molecular weights of 14 kDa, 11.7 kDa, 66 kDa, 4.2 kDa, and 80 kDa. This pattern reached a sensitivity of 80\% and specificities of 75\% (AD versus healthy control subjects), 95\% (AD versus other neurological disorders), and 85\% (AD versus both other groups). These values are comparable to the diagnostic accuracy obtained by standard diagnostic procedures. However, the combination of several diagnostic patterns into a "committee of experts" analysis led to correct classification of up to 100\% of the test samples. By these patterns together with univariate statistical analysis of the proteomic data seven putative bio-marker candidates were found, three of which were identified. Two of these marker candidates were shown to be different forms of transthyretin, namely the glutathionylated form and an N-terminally truncated form, whereas the third bio-marker was shown to be Apolipoprotein AI. Transthyretin is a thyroid hormone carrier protein which also binds A$\beta$ peptide and has been reported to protect neurons against A$\beta$ toxicity. Apolipoprotein AI is the major component of plasma HDL and participates in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver. Apolipoprotein AI therefore plays a role in cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis which is believed to play a role in the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The putative markers not yet identified have molecular weights of 4.6 kDa, 7.7 kDa, 40 kDa and 51 kDa and seem to separate more generally the healthy status from neurological disease. In conclusion, the principle of using protein patterns in CSF for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was demonstrated and three bio-marker candidates which may be interesting from a pathophysiological point of view were identified.}

    abstract =  "Sensor nodes are small, inexpensive, and programmable devices that combine an autonomous power supply with computing, sensing, and wireless communication capabilities. Networks of sensor nodes can be deployed in the environment at a large scale to unobtrusively monitor phenomena of the real world. Wireless sensor networks are an emerging field of research with many potential applications. So far, however, only few applications have actually been realized. This is in part due to the lack of appropriate programming support, which makes the development of sensor-network applications tedious and error prone. This dissertation contributes a novel programming model and development environment for the efficient, modular, and well structured programming of wireless sensor nodes. Today there are two principal programming models used for sensor nodes, the multi-threaded model and the event-driven model. The multi-threaded model requires system support that is often considered too heavy for sensor nodes that operate at the low end of the resource spectrum. To cope with this issue, the event-driven model has been proposed. It requires very little runtime support by the system software and can thus be implemented even on the most constrained sensor nodes. The simple and lightweight approach to system software, however, tends to make event-driven applications in turn quite memory inefficient: Since the event-driven model limits the use of local variables, programmers need to store temporary data in global variables. The memory of global variables, however, cannot easily and automatically be reused, hence the memory inefficiency. To counter this effect, programmers can resort to manual memory management, though this significantly affects program correctness and code modularity. In addition to its drawback of memory inefficiency, event-driven programming requires developers to manually keep track of the current program-state, which makes code modularization and debugging difficult, and leads to unstructured code. The key contribution of this dissertation is to show that the inadequacies of the event-driven model can be remedied without impairing its positive aspects, particularly its memory-efficient realization in sensor-node system software. Concretely, we present the Object State Model (OSM), a programming model that extends the event-driven programming paradigm with a notion of hierarchical and concurrent program states. Our thesis is that such a state-based model allows to specify well-structured, modular, and memory-efficient programs, yet requires as few runtime-resources as the event-driven model. To support this claim, we also present a programming environment based on the OSM model (including a programming language and compiler), as well as a sensor-node operating system capable of executing OSM programs. The main idea behind OSM is to explicitly model sensor-node programs as state machines, where variables are associated with states and computational operations are associated with state transitions. In OSM, states serve three purposes. Firstly, states are used as scoping mechanism for variables. The scope and lifetime of variables attached to a state is confined to that state and all of its substates. The memory for storing a state's variables is automatically reclaimed by the runtime system as the program leaves the corresponding state. State variables can be thought of as the local variables of OSM. As such they represent a great advancement over event-driven programming, where the majority of variables effectively have global scope and lifetime. By modeling temporary data with state variables, the use of OSM can significantly increase a program's memory efficiency. Secondly, the explicit notion of program states allows to model the structure and control flow of a program on a high abstraction level. Specifically, programs can be initially specified in terms of coarse modules (i.e., states), which can be subsequently refined (with substates), leading to modular and readable program code. The third purpose of states is to provide a context for computational operations. States clearly define which variables are visible, and at what point in the control flow the program resides when an operation is executed. In the event-driven model, in contrast, the program's context has to be maintained manually, which typically constitutes a significant fraction of the code, thus making the program hard to read and error prone. The OSM programming language captures the three concepts described above in order to foster memory efficient, modular, and well-structured programs. A compiler for the proposed language transforms state-based OSM programs back into an event-driven program notation, adding code for automatic memory management of state variables and code for automatic control-flow management. The compiler-generated code is very lean and does not impose additional requirements on the system software, such as dynamic memory management. Rather, the transformed programs are directly executable on our event-driven system software for resource-constrained sensor nodes. Our language, compiler, and sensor-node system software form the basis of our thesis and constitute a complete state-based programming environment for resource-constrained sensor nodes based on OSM."

    abstract =  {Many efforts are currently going towards networking smart things from the physical world (e.g. RFID, wireless sensor and actuator networks, embedded devices) networked on a larger scale. Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g. HTML, URI, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g. browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share things. In this paper, we begin by describing a Web of Things architecture and best practices rooted on the RESTful principles that contributed to the popular success, scalability, and evolvability of the traditional Web. We then discuss several prototypes implemented using these principles to connect environmental sensor nodes, energy monitoring systems and RFID tagged objects to the World Wide Web. We finally show how Web-enabled things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications called "physical mashups".}

Although this read-only Web of Data enables data integration, faceted browsing and structured queries over large datasets, we lack a general concept for a read-write Web of Data. That is, we need to understand how to create, update and delete RDF data. Starting from the experience we have gathered with Tabulator Redux --- a single-triple update system based on a data Wiki --- we review necessary components to realize a read-write Web of Data. We propose a form-based editing approach for RDF graphs along with the integration of site-specific APIs. Further, we present a concept of a uniform architecture for a read-write Web of Data, including a demonstration. Eventually, our work reveals issues and challenges of the proposed architecture and discusses future steps."

These scientists have demonstrated they can often 'reidentify' or 'deanonymize' individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we will realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed. This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention. We must respond to the surprising failure of anonymization, and this article provides the tools to do so."

A majority of Californians understands that wireless phones can track their location, and that there is broad support for location tracking in emergency situations. When compared with Professor Alan Westin's three privacy segments, "Fundamentalists," "Pragmatists," and the "Unconcerned," Californians are more likely to be privacy pragmatists or fundamentalists, and less likely to be unconcerned about privacy. Generally, Westin's segmentation was not predictive of Californians' attitudes towards law enforcement access to wireless location data.}

    abstract =  "Ajax applications are designed to have high user interactivity and low user-perceived latency. Real-time dynamic web data such as news headlines, stock tickers, and auction updates need to be propagated to the users as soon as possible. However, Ajax still suffers from the limitations of the Web's request/response architecture which prevents servers from pushing real-time dynamic web data. Such applications usually use a pull style to obtain the latest updates, where the client actively requests the changes based on a predefined interval. It is possible to overcome this limitation by adopting a push style of interaction where the server broadcasts data when a change occurs on the server side. Both these options have their own trade-offs. This paper explores the fundamental limits of browser-based applications and analyzes push solutions for Ajax technology. It also shows the results of an empirical study comparing push and pull."

These networks recently attracted great interest in a number of application domains concerned with monitoring and control of physical phenomena, as they enable dense and untethered deployments at low cost and with unprecedented flexibility. However, application development is still the main hurdle to a wide adoption of WSN technology. Programming is typically carried out very close to the operating system, therefore requiring the programmer to focus on low-level system issues. This not only shifts the focus of the programmer away from the application logic, but also requires a technical background that is rarely found among application domain experts. The need for appropriate high-level programming abstractions, capable to simplify the programming chore without sacrificing efficiency, has been long recognized and several solutions have been hitherto proposed, which differ along many dimensions. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art in programming approaches for WSNs. We begin with a characterization of WSN applications, to identify the fundamental requirements programming platforms must deal with. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of WSN programming abstractions which captures the fundamental differences among existing approaches, and constitutes the core contribution of this paper. Our presentation style relies on concrete examples and code snippets taken from programming platforms representative of the taxonomy dimensions being discussed. We use the taxonomy to provide an exhaustive classification of existing approaches. Moreover, we also map existing approaches back to the application requirements, therefore providing not only a complete view of the state-of-the-art, but also useful insights for selecting the programming abstraction most appropriate to the application at hand."

Geocoding is a key bridge linking the old and the new --- a world in which streets and street addresses served as the primary location identifiers and the modern world in which more precise representations are possible and needed to explore, analyze, and visualize geographic patterns, their drivers, and their consequences. Geocoding, viewed from this perspective, brings together the knowledge and work of the geographer and the computer scientist. The author, Daniel Goldberg, has done an excellent job in laying out the fundamentals of geocoding as a process using the best contributions from both of these once-disparate fields. This book will serve as a rich reference manual for those who want to inject more science and less art (uncertainty) into their geocoding tasks. This is particularly important for medical geography and epidemiology applications, as recent research findings point to environmental conditions that may contribute to and/or exacerbate health problems that vary over distances of hundreds and even tens of meters (i.e., as happens with proximity to free-ways). These findings call for much better and more deliberate geocoding practices than many practitioners have used to date and bring the contents of this best practices manual to the fore. This book provides a long overdue summary of the state-of-the-art of geocoding and will be essential reading for those that wish and/or need to generate detailed and accurate geographic positions from street addresses and the like."

Metadata --- data about data --- allows systems to collocate related information, and helps users find relevant information. The creation of metadata has generally been approached in two ways: professional creation and author creation. In libraries and other organizations, creating metadata, primarily in the form of catalog records, has traditionally been the domain of dedicated professionals working with complex, detailed rule sets and vocabularies. The primary problem with this approach is scalability and its impracticality for the vast amounts of content being produced and used, especially on the World Wide Web. The apparatus and tools built around professional cataloging systems are generally too complicated for anyone without specialized training and knowledge. A second approach is for metadata to be created by authors. The movement towards creator described documents was heralded by SGML, the WWW, and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. There are problems with this approach as well --- often due to inadequate or inaccurate description, or outright deception. This paper examines a third approach: user-created metadata, where users of the documents and media create metadata for their own individual use that is also shared throughout a community."

Furthermore, we claim that the attempt JAX-RPC makes to extend the remote method invocation metaphor to SOAP services is counterproductive. We base our argument both upon experience with JAX-RPC and SOAP, and upon experience of previous distributed computing technologies. We argue that JAX-RPC is not capable of delivering on the SOAP design goals, but conclude by suggesting an alternate system, Alpine, which is free from many known flaws of existing systems, and should prove better able to deliver upon the promise of SOAP."

They are cumulatively called schema languages or validation languages and they comprise, among others, DTD, XML Schema, RELAX NG, Schematron, DSD, xlinkit. One major point of discrimination among schema languages is the support of co-constraints, or co-occurrence constraints, e.g., requiring that attribute A is present if and only if attribute B is (or is not) present in the same element. Although there is no way in XML Schema to express these requirements, they are in fact frequently used in many XML document types, usually only expressed in plain human-readable text, and validated by means of special code modules by the relevant applications. In this paper we propose SchemaPath, a light extension of XML Schema to handle conditional constraints on XML documents. Two new constructs have been added to XML Schema: conditions --- based on XPath patterns --- on type assignments for elements and attributes; and a new simple type, xsd:error, for the direct expression of negative constraints (e.g., it is prohibited for attribute A to be present if attribute B is also present). A proof-of-concept implementation is provided. A Web interface is publicly accessible for experiments and assessments of the real expressiveness of the proposed extension."

And by "complex situations" we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers--whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human "feel for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids. Man's population and gross product are increasing at a considerable rate, but the complexity of his problems grows still faster, and the urgency with which solutions must be found becomes steadily greater in response to the increased rate of activity and the increasingly global nature of that activity. Augmenting man's intellect, in the sense defined above, would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society if there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible benefits. This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing means to augment the human intellect. These "means" can include many things--all of which appear to be but extensions of means developed andused in the past to help man apply his native sensory, mental, and motor capabilities--and we consider the whole system of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.}

SGML content models may include so called and groups, which are excluded from XML. An and group, which is a sequence of subexpressions separated by an \&-operator, denotes the sequential catenation of its subexpressions in any possible order. If one wants to shift from SGML to XML in document production, one has to translate SGML content models to corresponding XML content models. The allowed content models in both SGML and XML are restricted by a requirement of determinism, which means that a parser recognizing document element contents has to be able to decide without lookahead, which content model token to match with the current input token, while processing the document from left to right. It is known that not all SGML content models can be expressed as an equivalent XML content model. It is also known that transforming an SGML content model into an equivalent XML content model may cause an exponential growth in the length of the content model. We discuss methods of eliminating and groups and analyze the circumstances where they can be applied. We derive a tight bound of e n! on the number of symbols in the result of eliminating an and group of n symbols, where e = 2.71828... is the base of natural logarithms. We present the analysis in a pedagogical manner, emphasizing mathematical methods which are typical to the analysis of algorithms. We also show that minimal deterministic automata for recognizing an and group of n distinct element names contain 2^n states and n^{2n-1} transitions, excluding the failure state and transitions leading to it."

The right-hand side of a production, called a content model, is both an extended and a restricted regular expression. The semantics of content models for SGML DTDs can be modified by exceptions (XML does not allow exceptions). Inclusion exceptions allow named elements to appear anywhere within the content of a content model, and exclusion exceptions preclude named elements from appearing in the content of a content model. We give precise definitions of the semantics of exceptions, and prove that they do not increase the expressive power of SGML DTDs when we restrict DTDs according to accepted SGML practice. We prove the following results: 1. Exceptions do not increase the expressive power of extended context-free grammars. 2. For each DTD with exceptions, we can obtain a structurally equivalent extended context-free grammar. 3. For each DTD with exceptions, we can construct a structurally equivalent DTD when we restrict the DTD to adhere to accepted SGML practice. 4. Exceptions are a powerful shorthand notation --- eliminating them may cause exponential growth in the size of an extended context-free grammar or of a DTD."

We focused on exploring what motivates people to use their smart phones, what applications they use, what information they access or produce, when and for how long they interact with their phones, and how this usage relates to other tasks and devices. Our results suggest that the use of next-generation mobile phones depends heavily on contexts, particularly users' other devices and the places and situations users encounter. We observed that users employ their mobile phones in concert with, not independent of, their other computers. Rather than just mimicking desktop use, however, they employ their phones in different ways and for new tasks. The places and situations in which users employ their phones shape the tasks they undertake and how they make time to use their devices, fill idle time with them, or defer tasks to their other devices. We draw on our observations to offer design implications, focusing on how to support mobile phone use in the context of other devices and different places and situations."

Two types of redundancy are defined and discussed. One type may be employed to improve accessibility of certain kinds of information which happen to be in great demand. When either type of redundancy exists, those responsible for control of the data bank should know about it and have some means of detecting any "logical" inconsistencies in the total set of stored relations. Consistency checking might be helpful in tracking down unauthorized (and possibly fraudulent) changes in the data bank contents.}

These differences are required because distributed systems require that the programmer be aware of latency, have a different model of memory access, and take into account issues of concurrency and partial failure. We look at a number of distributed systems that have attempted to paper over the distinction between local and remote objects, and show that such systems fail to support basic requirements of robustness and reliability. These failures have been masked in the past by the small size of the distributed systems that have been built. In the enterprise-wide distributed systems foreseen in the near future, however, such a masking will be impossible. We conclude by discussing what is required of both systems-level and application-level programmers and designers if one is to take distribution seriously."

It is hoped that understanding interconnectedness as it is practised in the Web through links will enable us to see what kinds of hypertext are achievable using common technologies and what is impracticable. Understanding the arrangement of the links helps us to understand the construction of the page as a whole which in turn helps us to understand the purpose of the links. This paper discusses a search for examples of good subject-based hypertext linking, the linking statistics that we drew from those pages and the linking practises that the statistics represent. We also show how the analysis of how hypertext links are written can be applied to the problem of Web page reading in non-standard and reduced-bandwidth Web browsing applications."

In this paper, we investigate algorithms for generic schema  matching, outside of any particular data model or application. We first present a taxonomy for past solutions, showing that a rich range of techniques is available. We then propose a new algorithm, Cupid, that discovers mappings between schema elements based on their names, data types, constraints,  and schema structure, using a broader set of techniques than past approaches. Some of our innovations are the integrated use of  linguistic and structural matching, context-dependent matching of shared types, and a bias toward leaf structure where much of  the schema content resides. After describing our algorithm, we present experimental results that compare Cupid to two other schema matching systems."

The XML Schema Path Language (SPath) presented in this paper provides access to XML Schema components by extending the well-known XPath language to also include the domain of XML Schemas. Using SPath, XML developers gain better access to XML Schemas and thus can more easily develop software which is type- or schema-oriented."

This problem can be approached in two different approaches, the first being a tightly coupled approach for scenarios targeting an integrated system architecture, and the second being a loosely coupled approach, being centered around cooperating services in the open world of the Web. This paper argues that the current specifications for location-oriented services cater mainly for the tightly coupled approach, whereas the loosely coupled approach is not yet addressed by available specifications. A more lightweight and loosely coupled approach to location-oriented services is the central issue for making the valuable data in geographic information systems better available on the Web. Only if location-oriented services can be used easily and cooperatively, today's rapidly evolving infrastructure of wireless data services and mobile devices can take full advantage of these services.}

Providing users with mechanisms which allow them to control how they want to expose their location information, and thus allow control over how to share location information with others and services, is a crucial step for better location management for mobile devices. This paper presents a concept for representing location vocabularies, matching and mapping them, how these vocabularies can be used to support better privacy for users of location-based services, and better location sharing between users and services. The concept is based on a language for describing place name vocabularies, which we call "Place Markup Language (PlaceML)", and on various ways how these vocabularies can be used in a location-aware infrastructure of networked devices.}

In this paper we present the Feed Subscription Management (FSM) architecture, which is a model for managing feed subscriptions and supports structured feed subscriptions. Based on FSM, it is easy to build services that manage feed-based services so that those feed-based services can easily create, change and delete feed subscriptions, and that it is easily possible to share feed subscriptions across users and/or devices. Our main reason for focusing on feeds is that we see feeds as a good foundation for an ecosystem of RESTful services, and thus our architectural approach revolves around the idea of modeling services as interactions with feeds."

This basic design of RESTful services means that for extracting the most useful information from a service, it is necessary to understand a service's representations, which means both the semantics in terms of describing a resource, and also its semantics in terms of describing its linkage with other resources. Based on the Resource Linking Language (ReLL), this paper describes a framework for how RESTful services can be described, and how these descriptions can then be used to harvest information from these services. Building on this framework, a layered model of RESTful service semantics allows to represent a service's information in RDF/OWL. Because REST is based on the linkage between resources, the same model can be used for aggregating and interlinking multiple services for extracting RDF data from sets of RESTful services."

The Recovery Act provides an excellent case study to better understand the general requirements for designing and deploying "Open Government" systems. In this document, we show specific examples of how problems in data quality, service design, and systems architecture limit the effectiveness of ARRA's promised transparency. We also highlight organizational and incentive issues that impede transparency, and point to design processes as well as general architectural principles needed to better realize the goals advanced by open government advocates.}

This paper conceptualizes feeds as a way to serialize query results, describes the current hardcoded query semantics of such a perspective, and surveys the ways in which extensions of this hardcoded model have been proposed or implemented. Our generalized view of feeds as query result serializations has implications for the applicability of feeds as a generic Web service for any collection that is providing access to individual information items. As one interesting and compelling class of applications, we describe a simple way in which a query-based approach to feeds can be used to support location-based services."

There are two main benefits of such a service. Firstly, it would be easier to implement new collaborative applications because of the possibility to use an existing service. Secondly, it would be possible for different applications to share collaboration relevant information because of a common database of information about users and groups maintained by the GMS. One important property of the GMS is its flexibility with respect to the information stored. It is possible to store application-independent as well as application-dependent information. Using an object-oriented approach, applications can share the application-independent information (such as a group's members and administrative information) and can also use the GMS to store application-dependent information which can only be interpreted by a closed set of applications (those who know the syntax and semantics of the application-dependent information). The model of the GMS is very simple and consists mainly of two classes of objects, namely user and group. A small set of operations is provided for querying and modifying GMS information. The possibility to store application-dependent information is realized by allowing using application to create derived classes (ie subclasses) of the classes user and group. Thus it is possible for applications using the GMS to implement their own user and group classes without losing the ability to manage these objects with the GMS. Two applications are presented which may use the GMS to manage their users and groups. Both applications use application-specific derived classes of user and group. However, it is still possible for these applications to share the application-independent information of their users and groups."

One framework supporting this functionality is Sun's J2EE platform with its Message-Driven Beans (MDB) model. We present a novel way to use MDBs by providing a way to add routing information to the messages, which is then used to send a message through a given path of processing components. We call this model Routed Message-Driven Beans (RMDB), and the two main topics that are important for RMDBs are (1) the message format that is used for the routing information, and (2) the API which can be used by programmers to take advantage of the abstraction provided by RMDBs. Performance measurements show that the overhead caused by our RMDB framework is acceptable if messages are routed through several EJBs."

In this paper, we describe the concept and the prototype of an application for the management of metadata for a specific domain, metadata associated with pictures. The goal of the paper is to highlight the benefits which result from employing Web technologies instead of proprietary data formats. While we think that both application developers as well as users could benefit from such an approach, we are aware that in many real-world cases other issues (such as the ability to bind users to a certain product) also play an important role. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that open and well-documented technologies not only can make software development easier, but also open up synergies between standards-compliant products. While the prototype we present in this paper is not sophisticated enough to be released to the general public, we hope that software vendors will consider incorporating some of the concepts introduced in this paper."

Assuming an underlying system similar to Topic Maps, which allows storing, managing, and categorizing meta data and links, we propose a presentation of extended links. We try to provide a usable way for users to handle the additional functionality. The mechanism is based on already available technologies like DHTML. It is one facet of our approach to make the Web more interconnected and to work towards a more richly and openly linked Web."

These applications have widely varying data models, ranging from very simple regular trees to irregularly structured graphs using many different types of nodes and vertices. While some applications are sufficiently supported by the data model provided by the XML Infoset itself, others could benefit from extensions of the data model and assistance for these extensions in supporting XML technologies (such as the DOM API or the XSLT programming language). In this paper, we describe the Extensible XML Information Set (EXIS), which is a reformulation of the XML Infoset targeted at making the Infoset easier to extend and to make these extensions usable in higher-level XML technologies. EXIS provides a framework for defining extensions to the core XML Infoset, and for identifying these extensions (using namespace names). Higher-level XML technologies (such as DOM or XPath) can then support EXIS extensions through additional interfaces, such as a dedicated DOM module, or XPath extension mechanisms (extension axes and/or functions). In order to make EXIS work, additional efforts are required in these areas of higher-level XML technologies, but EXIS itself could be used rather quickly to provide a foundation for well-defined Infoset extensions, such as XML Schema's PSVI contributions, or the reformulation of XLink as being based on a data model (rather than a syntax)."

In this paper, we describe our goal to design and implement an advanced system for collections of references. The primary goal of this system is to provide users with a tool that matches their requirements of semantic richness vs. usability, which are competing goals. As a first step towards this goal, we designed and conducted a survey among the employees of a large university, trying to find out how people are managing their references today, and what their expectations are if a new tool became available. The results of the survey are presented, followed by conclusions that are the guiding principles for the upcoming ShaRef project. The goal of this project is to design and implement a system for reference management that runs Web-based as well as stand-alone, is easy to use, supports collaborative collections of references and collection sharing, has an open and extensible data model, covers the majority of user requirements according to the 80/20 principle, and thus provides scientists and scholars with a better way to manage their collections of references."

We believe that eBooks and ePublishing of pre-packaged materials in general should be an important enough use case to influence some of the relevant HTML5 standards, and the current landscape of over 50 specs under development makes it non-trivial to match identified eBook-reader uses cases against current WaaP capabilities. Our proposal is to work towards a functional description of eBook readers that makes it easy for eBook producers and the creators of eBook readers to decide whether a pure WaaP approach is currently feasible for them or not.

The group and session management system (GMS) is a distributed directory system which is specifically designed to support group communication infrastructures. This report briefly introduces the concepts of GMS, the data types available, and then gives the specification of GSP, the GMS system protocol. This protocol is used for communication between GSAs, ie it is used for GMS's internal communication. GSP is specified by state diagrams, time sequence diagrams, textual descriptions, the PDU syntax in ASN.1, and the PDU semantics in comments given for each PDU."

Besides technical means required for editing a given document by several users simultaneously, there is also a demand for communication mechanisms which are able to support the synchronization of the users. The system presented in this paper does not only offer multi-user multimedia editing capabilities but also provides a shared workspace and an environment for communication both via terminals and via telephone. The shared workspace is a concept which allows the members of a conference to share documents and other data. Telephone communications enable members of a collaborative editing session to have conference connections and to dynamically form subgroups."

    abstract =  {Service management and design has thus far primarily focused on the interactions between employees and customers. This perspective holds that the quality of the "service experience" is determined by the customer during this final "service encounter" that takes place in the "front stage." This emphasis discounts the contribution of the activities in the "back stage" of the service value chain where materials or information needed by the front stage are processed. However, the vast increase in web-driven consumer self-service applications and other automated services requires new thinking about service design and service quality. It is essential to consider the entire network of services that comprise the back and front stages as complementary parts of a "service system." We need new concepts and methods in service design that recognize how back stage information and processes can improve the front stage experience. This paper envisions a methodology for designing service systems that synthesizes (front-stage-oriented) user-centered design techniques with (back-stage) methods for designing information-intensive applications.}

Designing Usable Electronic Text, Second Edition explores the human issues that underlie information usage and stresses that usability is the main barrier to the electronic medium's campaign to gain mass acceptance. The book is a revision of the successful First Edition with a new emphasis on the Web and hypertext design and their impacts. With the emergence of new uses of information, such as e-commerce and telemedicine, text presentation will take on a new and greater importance. Its focus on the design framework and its empirical approach make it a unique book."

    abstract =  "Paratexts are those liminal devices and conventions, both within and outside the book, that form part of the complex mediation between book, author, publisher and reader: titles, forewords, epigraphs and publishers' jacket copy are part of a book's private and public history. In this first English translation of Paratexts, Gerard Genette shows how the special pragmatic status of paratextual declaration requires a carefully calibrated analysis of their illocutionary force. With clarity, precision and an extraordinary range of reference, Paratexts constitutes an encyclopedic survey of the customs and institutions as revealed in the borderlands of the text. Genette presents a global view of these liminal mediations and the logic of their relation to the reading public by studying each element as a literary function. Richard Macksey's foreword describes how the poetics of paratexts interact with more general questions of literature as a cultural institution, and situates Gennet's work in contemporary literary theory."

    abstract =  "Instant electronic access to digital information is the single most distinguishing attribute of the information age. The elaborate retrieval mechanisms that support such access are a product of technology. But technology is not enough. The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put into organizing it. Just as the practical field of engineering has theoretical physics as its underlying base, the design of systems for organizing information rests on an intellectual foundation. The subject of this book is the systematized body of knowledge that constitutes this foundation. Integrating the disparate disciplines of descriptive cataloging, subject cataloging, indexing, and classification, the book adopts a conceptual framework that views the process of organizing information as the use of a special language of description called a bibliographic language. The book is divided into two parts. The first part is an analytic discussion of the intellectual foundation of information organization. The second part moves from generalities to particulars, presenting an overview of three bibliographic languages: work languages, document languages, and subject languages. It looks at these languages in terms of their vocabulary, semantics, and syntax. The book is written in an exceptionally clear style, at a level that makes it understandable to those outside the discipline of library and information science."

    abstract =  {Over the past thirty years, many people have proclaimed the imminent arrival of the paperless office. Yet even the World Wide Web, which allows almost any computer to read and display another computer's documents, has only increased the amount of printing done by computer users. The use of e-mail in an organization increases paper consumption by an average of 40 percent. In The Myth of the Paperless Office, Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper study paper usage as a way to understand the work that people do and the reasons they do it the way they do. Using the tools of enthnography and cognitive psychology, they look at paper use from the level of the individual up to that of organizational culture. Central to Sellen and Harper's investigation is the concept of "affordances" --- the activities that an object allows, or affords. The physical properties of paper (its being thin, light, porous, opaque, and flexible) afford the human actions of grasping, carrying, folding, writing, and so on. The concept of affordance allows us to compare the affordances of paper with those of existing digital devices. We can then ask what kinds of devices or systems would make new kinds of activities possible or better support current activities. The authors argue that paper will continue to play an important role in office life. Rather than pursue the ideal of the paperless office, we should work toward a future in which paper and electronic document tools work in concert and organizational processes make optimal use of both.}

Document engineering is needed to analyze, design, and implement these Internet information exchanges. This book is an introduction to the emerging field of document engineering."

    abstract =  {Georeferencing --- relating information to geographic location --- has been incorporated into today's information systems in various ways. We use online services to map our route from one place to another; science, business, and government increasingly use geographic information systems (GIS) to hold and analyze data. Most georeferenced information searches using today's information systems are done by text query. But text searches for placenames fall short--when, for example, a place is known by several names (or by none). In addition, text searches don't cover all sources of geographic data; maps are traditionally accessed only through special indexes, filing systems, and agency contacts; data from remote sensing images or aerial photography is indexed by geospatial location (mathematical coordinates such as longitude and latitude). In this book, Linda Hill describes the advantages of integrating placename-based and geospatial referencing, introducing an approach to "unified georeferencing" that uses placename and geospatial referencing interchangeably across all types of information storage and retrieval systems. After a brief overview of relevant material from cognitive psychology on how humans perceive and respond to geographic space, Hill introduces the reader to basic information about geospatial information objects, concepts of geospatial referencing, the role of gazetteer data, the ways in which geospatial referencing has been included in metadata structures, and methods for the implementation of geographic information retrieval (GIR). Georeferencing will be a valuable reference for librarians, archivists, scientific data managers, information managers, designers of online services, and any information professional who deals with place-based information.}

    abstract =  "Location-based services (LBS) are a new concept integrating a users geographic location with the general notion of services, such as dialing an emergency number from a cell phone or using a navigation system in a car. Incorporating both mobile communication and spatial data, these applications represent a novel challenge both conceptually and technically. The purpose of this book is to describe, in an accessible fashion, the various concepts underlying mobile location-based services. These range from general application-related ideas to technical aspects. Each chapter starts with a high level of abstraction and drills down to the technical details. Contributors examine each application from all necessary perspectives, namely, requirements, services, data, and scalability. An illustrative example begins early in the book and runs throughout, serving as a reference."

An OpenURL Framework Application is a networked service environment, in which packages of information are transported over a network. These packages have a description of a referenced resource at their core, and they are transported with the intent of obtaining context-sensitive services pertaining to the referenced resource. To enable the recipients of these packages to deliver such context-sensitive services, each package describes the referenced resource itself, the network context in which the resource is referenced, and the context in which the service request takes place. This Standard specifies how to construct these packages as Representations of abstract information constructs called ContextObjects. To this end, the OpenURL Framework Standard defines the following core components: Character Encoding, Serialization, Constraint Language, ContextObject Format, Metadata Format, and Namespace. In addition, this Standard defines Transport, a core component that enables communities to specify how to transport ContextObject Representations. Finally, this Standard specifies how a community can deploy a new OpenURL Framework Application by defining a new Community Profile, the last core component. This Standard defines the OpenURL Framework Registry and the rules that govern the usage of this Registry. The OpenURL Framework Registry contains all instances of all core components created by communities that have deployed OpenURL Framework Applications. This Standard defines and registers the initial content of the OpenURL Framework Registry, thereby deploying two distinct OpenURL Framework Applications."

It defines the nature of the components used and describes how those components are combined to create information structures. It provides an information model which is independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such an information model allows us to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions that we are encoding and facilitates the development of better mappings and cross-syntax translations. This document is primarily aimed at the developers of software applications that support Dublin Core metadata, people involved in developing new syntax encoding guidelines for Dublin Core metadata and people developing metadata application profiles based on DCMI vocabularies or on other compatible vocabularies. The DCMI Abstract Model builds on work undertaken by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The use of concepts from RDF is summarized below in Section 5. The DCMI Abstract Model is represented here using UML class diagrams. Readers that are not familiar with UML class diagrams should note that lines ending in a block-arrow should be read as 'is' or 'is a' (for example, "a value is a resource") and that lines starting with a block-diamond should be read as 'contains a' or 'has a' (for example, "a statement contains a property URI"). Other relationships are labeled appropriately. In this document, words and phrases in italics are defined in Section 7, Terminology.}

GeoRSS is simple proposal for geo-enabling, or tagging, "really simple syndication" (RSS) feeds with location information. GeoRSS proposes a standardized way in which location is encoded with enough simplicity and descriptive power to satisfy most needs to describe the location of Web content. GeoRSS may not work for every use, but it should serve as an easy-to-use geotagging encoding that is brief and simple with useful defaults but extensible and upwardly-compatible with more sophisticated encoding standards such as the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) GML (Geography Markup Language). Currently, there are two GeoRSS serializations: GeoRSS GML and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS GML is a formal GML Profile, and supports a greater range of features than GeoRSS Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than WGS84 latitude/longitude. GeoRSS is designed for use with Atom 1.0, RSS 2.0 and RSS 1.0, although it can be used just as easily in non-RSS XML encodings. GeoRSS Simple has greater brevity, but also has limited extensibility.}

The final solution blends a low-degree combiantion model to degree 70, a block-diagonal solution from degree 71 to 359, and a quadrature solution at degree 360. The model was used to compute geoid undulations accurate to better than one meter (with the exception of areas void of dense and accurate surface gravity data) and realize WGS84 as a true three-dimensional reference system. Additional results from the EGM96 solution include models of the dynamic ocean topography to degree 20 from T/P and ERS-1 together, and GEOSAT separately, and improved orbit determination for Earth-orbiting satellites."

It makes references to both TrueType and PostScript, as Open Font Format fonts combine the two technologies. Multimedia applications require a broad range of media-related standards. In addition to the typical audio and video applications, multimedia presentations include scalable 2D graphics and text supporting all languages of the world. Faithful reproduction of scalable multimedia content requires additional components including scalable font technology. The Open Font Format is an extension of the TrueType font format, adding support for PostScript font data. OFF fonts and the operating system services which support OFF fonts provide users with a simple way to install and use fonts, whether the fonts contain TrueType outlines or CFF (PostScript) outlines. The Open Font Format addresses the following goals: broader multi-platform support; excellent support for international character sets; excellent protection for font data; smaller file sizes to make font distribution more efficient; excellent support for advanced typographic control. PostScript data included in OFF fonts may be directly rasterized or converted to the TrueType outline format for rendering, depending on which rasterizers have been installed in the host operating system. But the user model is the same: OFF fonts just work. Users will not need to be aware of the type of outline data in OFF fonts. And font creators can use whichever outline format they feel provides the best set of features for their work, without worrying about limiting a font's usability. OFF fonts can include the OFF Layout tables, which allow font creators to design broader international and high-end typographic fonts. The OFF Layout tables contain information on glyph substitution, glyph positioning, justification, and baseline positioning, enabling text-processing applications to improve text layout. As with TrueType fonts, OFF fonts allow the handling of large glyph sets using Unicode encoding. Such encoding allows broad international support, as well as support for typographic glyph variants. Additionally, OFF fonts may contain digital signatures, which enable operating systems and browsing applications to identify the source and integrity of font files, including embedded font files obtained in web documents, before using them. Also, font developers can encode embedding restrictions in OFF fonts which cannot be altered in a font signed by the developer."

ISO/IEC 19503:2005 provides specifications for a set of XML Schema Definitions (XSD) production rules for transforming MOF-based metamodels into XML Schemas; a set of XML Document production rules for encoding and decoding MOF-based metadata; design principles for XMI-based Schemas and XML documents; a set of production rules for importing XML DTDs to a MOF-based metamodel. ISO/IEC 19503:2005 enhances metadata management and metadata interoperability in distributed object environments in general and in distributed development environments in particular. While it addresses stream-based metadata interoperability in the object analysis and design domain, ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (in part because it is MOF based) is equally applicable to metadata in many other domains."

    abstract =  {An ISO/IEC 11179-based metadata registry (MDR) (hereafter referred to as a "registry") is a tool for the management of shareable data; a comprehensive, authoritative source of reference information about data. It supports the standardization and harmonization processes by recording and disseminating data standards, which facilitates data sharing among organizations and users. It provides links to documents that refer to data elements and to information systems where data elements are used. When used in conjunction with an information database, the registry enables users to better understand the information obtained. A registry does not contain data itself. It contains the metadata that is necessary to clearly describe, inventory, analyze, and classify data. It provides an understanding of the meaning, representation, and identification of units of data. The standard identifies the information elements that need to be available for determining the meaning of a data element (DE) to be shared between systems. The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003 is to describe a set of procedures for the consistent registration of data elements and their attributes in a registry. ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003 is not a data entry manual, but a user's guide for conceptualizing a data element and its associated metadata items for the purpose of consistently establishing good quality data elements. An organization may adapt and/or add to these procedures as necessary. The scope of ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003 is limited to the associated items of a data element: the data element identifier, names and definitions in particular contexts, and examples; data element concept; conceptual domain with its value meanings; and value domain with its permissible values. There is a choice when registering code sets and other value domains in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry. Some Registration Authorities treat these sets as value domains, and others treat them as data elements. For the purposes of ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003, the choice will always be to treat the sets as data elements unless explicitly stated. This choice is made to help illustrate the way to register many different kinds of data elements, including examples for registering standard code sets as data elements.}

    abstract =  {ISO 21127:2006 establishes guidelines for the exchange of information between cultural heritage institutions. In simple terms this can be defined as the curated knowledge of museums. A more detailed definition can be articulated by defining both the intended scope, a broad and maximally inclusive definition of general principles, and the practical scope, which is defined by reference to a set of specific museum documentation standards and practices. The intended scope of ISO 21127:2006 is defined as the exchange and integration of heterogeneous scientific documentation relating to museum collections. This definition requires further elaboration: The term "scientific documentation" is intended to convey the requirement that the depth and quality of descriptive information that can be handled by ISO 21127:2006 need be sufficient for serious academic research. This does not mean that information intended for presentation to members of the general public is excluded, but rather that ISO 21127:2006 is intended to provide the level of detail and precision expected and required by museum professionals and researchers in the field. The term "museum collections" is intended to cover all types of material collected and displayed by museums and related institutions, as defined by ICOM. This includes collections, sites, and monuments relating to fields such as social history, ethnography, archaeology, fine and applied arts, natural history, history of sciences and technology. The documentation of collections includes the detailed description of individual items within collections, groups of items and collections as a whole. ISO 21127:2006 is specifically intended to cover contextual information (i.e. the historical, geographical, and theoretical background that gives museum collections much of their cultural significance and value). The exchange of relevant information with libraries and archives, and harmonization with their models, falls within the intended scope of ISO 21127:2006. Information required solely for the administration and management of cultural institutions, such as information relating to personnel, accounting, and visitor statistics, falls outside the intended scope of ISO 21127:2006. The practical scope of ISO 21127:2006 is the set of reference standards for museum documentation that have been used to guide and validate its development. ISO 21127:2006 covers the same domain of discourse as the union of these reference documents; this means that data correctly encoded according to any of these reference documents can be expressed in a compatible form, without any loss of meaning.}

JSON is syntax of braces, brackets, colons, and commas that is useful in many contexts, profiles, and applications. JSON was inspired by the object literals of JavaScript aka ECMAScript as defined in the ECMAScript Language Specification, third Edition. It does not attempt to impose ECMAScript's internal data representations on other programming languages. Instead, it shares a small subset of ECMAScript's textual representations with all other programming languages. JSON is agnostic about numbers. In any programming language, there can be a variety of number types of various capacities and complements, fixed or floating, binary or decimal. That can make interchange between different programming languages difficult. JSON instead offers only the representation of numbers that humans use: a sequence of digits. All programming languages know how to make sense of digit sequences even if they disagree on internal representations. That is enough to allow interchange."

    abstract =  {MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. The protocol runs over TCP/IP, or over other network protocols that provide ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections. Its features include: Use of the publish/subscribe message pattern which provides one-to-many message distribution and decoupling of applications; A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the payload; Three qualities of service for message delivery ("At most once", where messages are delivered according to the best efforts of the operating environment. Message loss can occur. This level could be used, for example, with ambient sensor data where it does not matter if an individual reading is lost as the next one will be published soon after, "At least once", where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates can occur, "Exactly once", where message are assured to arrive exactly once. This level could be used, for example, with billing systems where duplicate or lost messages could lead to incorrect charges being applied); A small transport overhead and protocol exchanges minimized to reduce network traffic; A mechanism to notify interested parties when an abnormal disconnection occurs.}

Executable business processes model actual behavior of a participant in a business interaction. Abstract business processes are partially specified processes that are not intended to be executed. An Abstract Process may hide some of the required concrete operational details. Abstract Processes serve a descriptive role, with more than one possible use case, including observable behavior and process template. WS-BPEL is meant to be used to model the behavior of both Executable and Abstract Processes. WS-BPEL provides a language for the specification of Executable and Abstract business processes. By doing so, it extends the Web Services interaction model and enables it to support business transactions.

    abstract =  "The requirement that all external identifiers in XML documents must provide a system identifier has unquestionably been of tremendous short-term benefit to the XML community. It has allowed a whole generation of tools to be developed without the added complexity of explicit entity management. However, the interoperability of XML documents has been impeded in several ways by the lack of entity management facilities: (1) External identifiers may require resources that are not always available. For example, a system identifier that points to a resource on another machine may be inaccessible if a network connection is not available. (2) External identifiers may require protocols that are not accessible to all of the vendors' tools on a single computer system. An external identifier that is addressed with the ftp: protocol, for example, is not accessible to a tool that does not support that protocol. (3) It is often convenient to access resources using system identifiers that point to local resources. Exchanging documents that refer to local resources with other systems is problematic at best and impossible at worst. The problems involved with sharing documents, or packages of documents, across multiple systems are large and complex. While there are many important issues involved and a complete solution is beyond the current scope, the OASIS membership agrees upon the enclosed set of conventions to address a useful subset of the complete problem. To address these issues, this Committee Specification defines an entity catalog that maps both external identifiers and arbitrary URI references to URI references."

It is based on unifying concepts of SOA and may be used by architects developing specific service oriented architectures or in training and explaining SOA. A reference model is not directly tied to any standards, technologies or other concrete implementation details. It does seek to provide a common semantics that can be used unambiguously across and between different implementations. The relationship between the Reference Model and particular architectures, technologies and other aspects of SOA is illustrated in Figure 1. While service-orientation may be a popular concept found in a broad variety of applications, this reference model focuses on the field of software architecture. The concepts and relationships described may apply to other "service" environments; however, this specification makes no attempt to completely account for use outside of the software domain.}

While WebDAV provides an extended set of services for editing the Web, HTTP/1.1 provides a minimal set of hooks for avoiding the lost problem by detecting when versions have changed so that changes aren't lost in the editing process. While simple, these hooks are fundamental to editing the Web using HTTP/1.1 and are needed in Webdav as well. This Note explains a) how to use HTTP/1.1 to detect the lost update problem using preconditions and strong etags and b) how to avoid problems with HTTP/1.0 clients that do not know about these features but only use plain HTTP PUT requests. Neither a) nor b) requires any changes to HTTP/1.1, but can be achieved using existing features. The mechanism has been implemented in Web Commander and Amaya (both using libwww), and Jigsaw --- all W3C Open Source software freely available to all interested parties. Detection is only one of several ways to avoid the lost update problem and this document discusses the pros and cons of various other mechanisms including exclusive locks and immutable revisions."

The World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard Web Services Description Language (WSDL) specifies a standard way to describe the interfaces of a Web Service at a syntactic level and how to invoke it. While the syntactic descriptions provide information about the structure of input and output messages of an interface and how to invoke them, semantics are needed to describe what a Web service actual does. These semantics when expressed in formal languages disambiguate the description of Web services interfaces paving the way for automatic discovery, composition and integration of software components. WSDL does not explicitly provide mechanisms to specify the semantics of a Web service. Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL) is an effort to define mechanisms by which semantic annotations can be added to WSDL components. Many of the concepts in SAWSDL are based on an earlier effort WSDL-S, a W3C submission. This usage guide is an accompanying document to SAWSDL specification. It presents examples to illustrate how to associate semantic annotations with a Web service that could be used for classifying, discovering, matching, composing, and invoking Web services. Some of the examples illustrated in this document use RDF and OWL Web Ontology Language for representing ontologies. Some knowledge of RDF and OWL is useful for understanding this document, but not essential."

WSCI describes the dynamic interface of the Web Service participating in a given message exchange by means of reusing the operations defined for a static interface. WSCI works in conjunction with the Web Service Description Language (WSDL), the basis for the W3C Web Services Description Working Group; it can, also, work with another service definition language that exhibits the same characteristics as WSDL. WSCI describes the observable behavior of a Web Service. This is expressed in terms of temporal and logical dependencies among the exchanged messages, featuring sequencing rules, correlation, exception handling, and transactions. WSCI also describes the collective message exchange among interacting Web Services, thus providing a global, message-oriented view of the interactions. WSCI does not address the definition and the implementation of the internal processes that actually drive the message exchange. Rather, the goal of WSCI is to describe the observable behavior of a Web Service by means of a message-flow oriented interface. This description enables developers, architects and tools to describe and compose a global view of the dynamic of the message exchange by understanding the interactions with the web service."

Establishing effective eGovernment requires openness, transparency, collaboration and skill in taking advantage of the capabilities of the World Wide Web. The rich potential for two-way dialogue between citizens and government creates a need for global leadership. The W3C has an opportunity to provide guidance in support of eGovernment objectives by promoting existing open Web standards and noting the challenges external to the Web and technology. There is also role for the W3C to facilitate the development and vetting of new open Web standards needed by governments in context. This document is an attempt to describe, but not yet solve, the variety of issues and challenges faced by governments in their efforts to apply 21st century capabilities to eGovernment initiatives. Detail and useful examples of existing, applicable open Web standards are provided. Where government needs in the development of eGovernment services are not currently met by existing standards, those gaps are noted."

    abstract =  {Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a result of continuous work to define an industry-wide specification for developing applications that operate over wireless communication networks. The scope of the WAP Forum is to define a set of specifications to be used by service applications. The wireless market is growing very quickly and reaching new customers and services. To enable operators and manufacturers to meet the challenges in advanced services, differentiation and fast/flexible service creation, WAP defines a set of protocols in transport, session and application layers. For additional information on the WAP architecture, refer to "Wireless Application Protocol Architecture Specification" (WAP). This specification defines a compact binary representation of the Extensible Markup Language (XML). The binary XML content format is designed to reduce the transmission size of XML documents, allowing more effective use of XML data on narrowband communication channels. Refer to the WML specification for one example use of the binary XML content format. The binary format was designed to allow for compact transmission with no loss of functionality or semantic information. The format is designed to preserve the element structure of XML, allowing a browser to skip unknown elements or attributes. The binary format encodes the parsed physical form of an XML document, i.e., the structure and content of the document entities. Meta-information, including the document type definition and conditional sections, is removed when the document is converted to the binary format.}

Our insight into the documents and capabilities available are based on keyword searches, abetted by clever use of document connectivity and usage patterns. The sheer mass of this data is unmanageable without powerful tool support. In order to map this terrain more precisely, computational agents require machine-readable descriptions of the content and capabilities of Web accessible resources. These descriptions must be in addition to the human-readable versions of that information. The OWL Web Ontology Language is intended to provide a language that can be used to describe the classes and relations between them that are inherent in Web documents and applications. This document demonstrates the use of the OWL language to (1) formalize a domain by defining classes and properties of those classes, (2) define individuals and assert properties about them, and (3) reason about these classes and individuals to the degree permitted by the formal semantics of the OWL language. The sections are organized to present an incremental definition of a set of classes, properties and individuals, beginning with the fundamentals and proceeding to more complex language components."

It is often convenient to put a class (e.g., Animal) as a property value (e.g., topic or book subject) when building an ontology. While OWL Full and RDF Schema do not put any restriction on using classes as property values, in OWL DL and OWL Lite most properties cannot have classes as their values. We illustrate the direct approach for representing classes as property values in OWL-Full and RDF Schema. We present various alternative mechanisms for representing the required information in OWL DL and OWL Lite. For each approach, we discuss various considerations that the users should keep in mind when choosing the best approach for their purposes."

However, in some cases, the natural and convenient way to represent certain concepts is to use relations to link an individual to more than just one individual or value. These relations are called n-ary relations. For example, we may want to represent properties of a relation, such as our certainty about it, severity or strength of a relation, relevance of a relation, and so on. Another example is representing relations among multiple individuals, such as a buyer, a seller, and an object that was bought when describing a purchase of a book. This document presents ontology patterns for representing n-ary relations in RDF and OWL and discusses what users must consider when choosing these patterns."

Modern software development tools with support for the UML and code generation as well as Model-Driven Architectures allow for developers to synchronize and verify technical implementation with user requirements using models. However, the reusability of domain models is often limited because they are, by definition, domain specific and only take into consideration abstractions needed to make possible a solution within the confines of their own individual problem space. But the Web is broader than that and provides a multidimensional solution space capable of referencing an almost limitless set of domains. While much of our software becomes increasingly embedded in the Web, our development processes do not fully exploit the potential of model reuse from the Web yet. This note therefore introduces Semantic Web languages such as RDF Schema and OWL, and shows how they can be used in tandem with mainstream object-oriented languages. We show that the Semantic Web can serve as a platform on which domain models can be created, shared and reused."

For example: "size" may describe persons or other physical objects and be constrained to take the values "small", "medium" or "large"; rank may describe military officers and restricted to a specific list of values depending on the military organisation. In OWL such descriptive features are modelled as properties whose range specifies the constraints on the values that the property can take on. This document describes two methods to represent such features and their specified values: 1) as partitions of classes; and 2) as enumerations of individuals.

Bundles, whose validity is established independently of each other, are essentially independent of each other, acting as islands of provenance descriptions. In applications where provenance is created by multiple parties over time, it is useful for provenance descriptions created by one party to link to provenance descriptions created by another party. Such a mechanism would allow the "stitching" of provenance descriptions together. Given that provenance descriptions are expected to be contained in bundles, this would require a capability to link entity descriptions across bundles. To address this requirement, this document introduces a relation Mention allowing an entity description to be linked to another entity description occurring in another bundle.}

While CCXML can be used with any dialog systems capable of handling media, CCXML has been designed to complement and integrate with a VoiceXML interpreter. Because of this there are many references to VoiceXML's capabilities and limitations. There are also details on how VoiceXML and CCXML can be integrated. However, it should be noted that the two languages are separate and are not required in an implementation of either language. For example, CCXML could be integrated with a more traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or a 3GPP Media Resource Function (MRF), and VoiceXML or other dialog systems could be integrated with other call control systems."

The results of semantic interpretation describe the meaning of a natural language utterance.

The W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity (MMI) is defining an XML data format (EMMA) for containing and annotating the information in user utterances.

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is used to create profiles that describe user agent capabilities and preferences. The structure of a profile is discussed. Topics include structure of client capability and preference descriptions, use of RDF classes to distinguish different elements of a profile, so that a schema-aware RDF processor can handle CC/PP profiles embedded in other XML document types. Version 2.0 of CC/PP ensures its alignment with the latest version of RDF. CC/PP vocabulary is identifiers (URIs) used to refer to specific capabilities and preferences, and covers the types of values to which CC/PP attributes may refer, an appendix describing how to introduce new vocabularies, an appendix giving an example small client vocabulary covering print and display capabilities, and an appendix providing a survey of existing work from which new vocabularies may be derived."

XForms is not a free-standing document type, but is intended to be integrated into other markup languages, such as XHTML, ODF or SVG. An XForms-based web form gathers and processes XML data using an architecture that separates presentation, purpose and content. The underlying data of a form is organized into instances of data schema (though formal schema definitions are not required). An XForm allows processing of data to occur using three mechanisms: (1) A declarative model composed of formulae for data calculations and constraints, data type and other property declarations, and data submission parameters. (2) A view layer composed of intent-based user interface controls. (3) An imperative controller for orchestrating data manipulations, interactions between the model and view layers, and data submissions. Thus, XForms accommodates form component reuse, fosters strong data type validation, eliminates unnecessary round-trips to the server, offers device independence and reduces the need for scripting. XForms 1.1 refines the XML processing platform introduced by XForms 1.0 by adding several new submission capabilities, action handlers, utility functions, user interface improvements, and helpful datatypes as well as a more powerful action processing facility, including conditional, iterated and background execution, the ability to manipulate data arbitrarily and to access event context information."

Web Forms 2.0 applies to both HTML and XHTML user agents. It provides new strongly-typed input fields, new attributes for defining constraints, a repeating model for declarative repeating of form sections, new DOM interfaces, new DOM events for validation and dependency tracking, and XML submission and initialization of forms. It also standardizes and codifies existing practice in areas that have not been previously documented, and clarifies some of the interactions of HTML form controls and CSS. HTML 4, XHTML 1.1, and the DOM are thus extended in a manner that has a clear migration path from existing HTML forms, leveraging the knowledge authors have built up with their experience with HTML so far."

Here are some of the new features in XQuery 1.1: 1. group by clause in FLWOR Expressions (3.8.7 Group By Clause). 2. tumbling window and sliding window in FLWOR Expressions (3.8.4 Window Clause). 3. count clause in FLWOR Expressions (3.8.6 Count Clause). 4. allowing empty in 3.8.2 For Clause, for functionality similar to outer joins in SQL. 5. try/catch expressions (3.13 Try/Catch Expressions). 6. Dynamic function invocation (3.1.8 Dynamic Function Invocation). 7. Inline functions (3.1.7 Inline Functions). 8. Private functions (4.17 Function Declaration). 9. Switch expressions (3.11 Switch Expression) 10. Computed namespace constructors (3.7.3.7 Computed Namespace Constructors). 11. Output declarations (2.2.4 Serialization). 12. Annotations (4.15 Annotations). 13. Annotation assertions in function tests."

Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general. WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific.

It is part of a series of documents that support WCAG 2.0. Please note that the contents of this document are informative (they provide guidance), and not normative (they do not set requirements for conforming to WCAG 2.0). See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview for an introduction to WCAG, supporting technical documents, and educational material. WCAG 2.0 establishes a set of Success Criteria to define conformance to the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines. A Success Criterion is a testable statement that will be either true or false when applied to specific Web content. "Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides detailed information about each Success Criterion, including its intent, the key terms that are used in the Success Criterion, and how the Success Criteria in WCAG 2.0 help people with different types of disabilities. This document also provides examples of Web content that meet the success criterion using various Web technologies (for instance, HTML, CSS, XML), and common examples of Web content that does not meet the success criterion. This document indicates specific techniques to meet each Success Criterion. Details for how to implement each technique are available in Techniques for WCAG 2.0, but "Understanding WCAG 2.0" provides the information about the relationship of each technique to the Success Criteria. Techniques are categorized by the level of support they provide for the Success Criteria. "Sufficient techniques" are sufficient to meet a particular Success Criterion (either by themselves or in combination with other techniques), while other techniques are advisory and therefore optional. None of the techniques are required to meet WCAG 2.0, although some may be the only known method if a particular technology is used. "Advisory techniques" are not sufficient to meet the Success Criteria on their own (because they are not testable or provide incomplete support) but it is encouraged that authors follow them when possible to provide enhanced accessibility. In addition to techniques for addressing the success criteria, "Common Failures" are also documented. These "Common Failures" are authoring practices that are known to cause Web content to fail to conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors must avoid those practices in order to meet the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria. This document is part of a series of documents published by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to support WCAG 2.0. This document was published as a Working Group Note at the same time WCAG 2.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. Unlike WCAG 2.0, is expected that the information in Understanding WCAG 2.0 will be updated from time to time.

This listing of features could also be used to help compare different types of evaluation tools, for example during the procurement of such tools. The features in scope of this document include capabilities to help specify, manage, carry out and report the results from web accessibility evaluations. For example, some of the described features relate to crawling of websites, interacting with tool users to carry out semi-automated evaluation, and providing evaluation results in a machine-readable format. This document does not describe the evaluation of web content features, which is addressed by WCAG 2.0 and its supporting documents. This document encourages the incorporation of accessibility evaluation features in all web authoring and quality assurance tools, and the continued development and creation of different types of web accessibility evaluation tools. The document does not prioritize nor require any particular accessibility evaluation feature or specific type of evaluation tools. It describes features that can be provided by tools that support fully-automated, semi-automated, and manual web accessibility evaluation. Following this document can help tool developers to meet accessibility checking requirements defined by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)."

It provides guidance on good practice in defining the evaluation scope, exploring the target website, selecting representative samples from websites where it is not feasible to evaluate all content, auditing the selected samples, and reporting the evaluation findings. It is primarily designed for evaluating existing websites, for example, to learn about them and to monitor their level of accessibility. It can also be useful during earlier design and development stages of websites. It applies to static and dynamically generated websites, mobile websites and applications, and other types of websites. It does not specify particular web technologies, evaluation tools, web browsers, assistive technologies, or other software to use for evaluation.

Accessibility metrics help indicate the accessibility level of websites, including the accessibility level of individual websites, or even large-scale surveys of the accessibility of many websites. Recently, a plethora of metrics has been released to complement the A, AA, and AAA Levels measurement used by the WAI guidelines. However, the validity and reliability of most of these metrics are unknown and those making use of them are taking the risk of using inappropriate metrics. In order to address these concerns, this note provides a framework that considers validity, reliability, sensitivity, adequacy and complexity as the main qualities that a metric should have. A symposium was organized to observe how current practices are addressing such qualities. We found that metrics addressing validity issues are scarce although some efforts can be perceived as far as inter-tool reliability is concerned. This is something that the research community should be aware of, as we might be making efforts by using metrics whose validity and reliability are unknown. The research realm is perhaps not mature enough or we do not have the right methods and tools. We therefore try to shed some light on the possible paths that could be taken so that we can reach a maturity point."

A third section explains how these content technologies fit in the larger picture of accessibility, both technically within a Web user agent and from a production process point of view. This document is most explicitly not a collection of baseline user agent or authoring tool requirements. It is important to recognize that not all user agents (nor all authoring tools) will support all the features discussed in this document. Rather, this document attempts to supply a comprehensive collection of user requirements needed to support media accessibility in the context of HTML5. As such, it should be expected that this document will continue to develop for some time. Please also note this document is not an inventory of technology currently provided by, or missing from HTML5 specification drafts. Technology listed here is here because it's important for accommodating the alternative access needs of users with disabilities to web-based media.

CGM has a significant following in technical illustration, electronic documentation, geophysical data visualization, amongst other application areas. WebCGM is a profile for the effective application of CGM in Web electronic documents. WebCGM has been a joint effort of the CGM Open Consortium, in collaboration with W3C staff and supported by the European Commission Esprit project. It represents an important interoperability agreement amongst major users and implementors of CGM, and thereby unifies current diverse approaches to CGM utilization in Web document applications. WebCGM's clear and unambiguous conformance requirements will enhance interoperability of implementations, and it should be possible to leverage existing CGM validation tools, test suites, and the product certification testing services for application to WebCGM. While WebCGM is a binary file format and is not "stylable", nevertheless WebCGM follows published W3C requirements for a scalable graphics format where such are applicable. The design criteria for the graphical content of WebCGM aimed at a balance between graphical expressive power on the one hand, and simplicity and implementability on the other. A small but powerful set of metadata elements is standardized in WebCGM, to support the functionalities of: hyperlinking and document navigation; picture structuring and layering; and, search and query on WebCGM picture content.}

    abstract =  {The last couple of years have witnessed a fascinating evolution: while the Web was initially built predominantly for human consumption, web content is increasingly consumed by machines which expect some amount of structured data. Sites have started to identify a page's title, content type, and preview image to provide appropriate information in a user's newsfeed when she clicks the "Like" button. Search engines have started to provide richer search results by extracting fine-grained structured details from the Web pages they crawl. In turn, web publishers are producing increasing amounts of structured data within their Web content to improve their standing with search engines. A key enabling technology behind these developments is the ability to add structured data to HTML pages directly. RDFa (Resource Description Framework in Attributes) is a technique that allows just that: it provides a set of markup attributes to augment the visual information on the Web with machine-readable hints. In this Primer, we show how to express data using RDFa in HTML, and in particular how to mark up existing human-readable Web page content to express machine-readable data. This document provides only a Primer to RDFa 1.1. The complete specification of RDFa, with further examples, can be found in the RDFa 1.1 Core, RDFa Lite, XHTML+RDFa 1.1, and the HTML5+RDFa 1.1 specifications.}

RDFa is a specification for attributes to express structured data in any markup language. This document specifies how to use RDFa with XHTML. The rendered, hypertext data of XHTML is reused by the RDFa markup, so that publishers don't need to repeat significant data in the document content. The underlying abstract representation is RDF, which lets publishers build their own vocabulary, extend others, and evolve their vocabulary with maximal interoperability over time. The expressed structure is closely tied to the data, so that rendered data can be copied and pasted along with its relevant structure. The rules for interpreting the data are generic, so that there is no need for different rules for different formats; this allows authors and publishers of data to define their own formats without having to update software, register formats via a central authority, or worry that two formats may interfere with each other. RDFa shares some use cases with microformats. Whereas microformats specify both a syntax for embedding structured data into HTML documents and a vocabulary of specific terms for each microformat, RDFa specifies only a syntax and relies on independent specification of terms (often called vocabularies or taxonomies) by others. RDFa allows terms from multiple independently-developed vocabularies to be freely intermixed and is designed such that the language can be parsed without knowledge of the specific term vocabulary being used. This document is a detailed syntax specification for RDFa, aimed at: those looking to create an RDFa parser, and who therefore need a detailed description of the parsing rules; those looking to recommend the use of RDFa within their organisation, and who would like to create some guidelines for their users; anyone familiar with RDF, and who wants to understand more about what is happening 'under the hood', when an RDFa parser runs.

The embedded data already available in the markup language (e.g., HTML) can often be reused by the RDFa markup, so that publishers don't need to repeat significant data in the document content. The underlying abstract representation is RDF, which lets publishers build their own vocabulary, extend others, and evolve their vocabulary with maximal interoperability over time. The expressed structure is closely tied to the data, so that rendered data can be copied and pasted along with its relevant structure. The rules for interpreting the data are generic, so that there is no need for different rules for different formats; this allows authors and publishers of data to define their own formats without having to update software, register formats via a central authority, or worry that two formats may interfere with each other. RDFa shares some of the same goals with microformats. Whereas microformats specify both a syntax for embedding structured data into HTML documents and a vocabulary of specific terms for each microformat, RDFa specifies only a syntax and relies on independent specification of terms (often called vocabularies or taxonomies) by others. RDFa allows terms from multiple independently-developed vocabularies to be freely intermixed and is designed such that the language can be parsed without knowledge of the specific vocabulary being used. This document is a detailed syntax specification for RDFa, aimed at: those looking to create an RDFa Processor, and who therefore need a detailed description of the parsing rules; those looking to integrate RDFa into a new markup language; those looking to recommend the use of RDFa within their organization, and who would like to create some guidelines for their users; anyone familiar with RDF, and who wants to understand more about what is happening 'under the hood', when an RDFa Processor runs. For those looking for an introduction to the use of RDFa and some real-world examples, please consult the RDFa Primer."

It's always useful to be able to retrieve the content at the URL, since the application can get either the entity or its description, and thus learns more about what is being talked about. While humans can usually discriminate between these different modes of using URLs based on what "makes sense", applications cannot in general do so. Therefore, in standard formats for data, where we want reliable conclusions to be drawn from the data by an application, the context in which the URL occurs must make clear which mode is intended in each case. This document addresses this problem by describing how to define data formats and publish the information necessary to support an application in determining which of mode is intended when it encounters a URL in data.}

Media type definitions therefore have to provide details about how fragids are interpreted for that media type. This document recommends best practices for the authors of media type definitions, for the authors of structured syntax suffix registrations (such as +xml), for the authors of specifications that define fragid structures, and for authors that publish documents that are intended to be used with fragids or who refer to fragments within documents using URIs with fragids. Media type registrations should ensure that fragids matching syntax "inherited" from top-level types such as image/* and +suffix registrations such as for +xml are always interpreted based on that generic processing. If the "inherited" fragid syntaxes overlap and may provide inconsistent meanings or processing for the same fragid, they should not adopt the +suffix. Where media type registrations reuse fragid structures that overlap, media type registrations should specify which take priority in resolving a given fragid. Media type registrations should also reserve the use of plain name fragids for local identifiers within content, and specify any restrictions on the interpretation of fragids by scripts. They should avoid defining new fragid structures within the registration document itself, and should avoid constraining how applications handle fragids that do not resolve. Structured syntax suffix registrations are based on a metaformat which usually will have its own media type registration. The +suffix registration should define the same fragid rules as are used in that media type registration. Further, they should specify that any fragids that do not resolve according to these rules should be handled in the way specified by the specific media type adopting that +suffix. The designers of fragid structures (such as XPointer) should avoid syntactic overlaps with existing fragid structures and ensure that fragids can be used across formats with similar semantics. Publishers should ensure that any addressable structures within documents that are served through content negotiation are consistent across content-negotiated variants. They should also ensure that scripts handle fragids consistently with the fragid rules for the relevant media type. Authors referring to URIs with fragids should avoid using fragids that are specific to a particular document format (such as XPointer, which is specific to XML) unless they can ascertain that the base URI only serves one representation.}

This is a convenient abstraction, but when social or legal concepts and frameworks relating documents, publishing and speech are applied to the Web, the analogies can be misleading, for example, publishing a page on the Web is fundamentally different from printing and distributing a page in a magazine or book. Communication is often subject to governance: legislation, legal opinion, regulation, convention and contract; these are ways in which society looks to enforce norms, for example, around copyright, censorship, and privacy. But there is often a mismatch between governance intended to apply to the Web (usually based on the analogy with physical media) and the technology and architecture used to create it. This document is intended to inform future social and legal discussions about the architecture of the Web: the ways in which the Web's technical facilities operate to store, publish and retrieve information, and by providing definitions for terminology as used within the Web's technical community. Specifically, this document has the following goals: Clarify that linking --- providing the location of some content --- is different in intention from including --- embedding content developed elsewhere within your own --- and should be treated differently by the law; Intermediaries, such as proxies and caches, and more controversially, search engines and aggregators that merely refer to or collect content developed elsewhere, should be treated differently than websites that create original content; In many cases, websites put legal restrictions on how the material they make available may be linked or reused. Such restrictions can be better enforced by using mechanisms provided by the web rather than by legal terms of use.}

Instead, there is a widespread lack of understanding or implementation of the technologies that the OWP already makes available for addressing most of the issues raised. However, some of the very technologies that are little used or understood in most sectors of publishing are widely used and understood in certain other sectors (e.g., scientific publishing, libraries). Priorities that have emerged are the need for better understanding of the importance of expressing identifiers as URIs; the need for much more widespread use of RDF and its various serializations throughout the publishing ecosystem; and the need to develop a truly interoperable, cross-sector specification for the conveyance of rights metadata (while remaining agnostic as to the sector-specific vocabularies for the expression of rights). This Note documents in detail the issues that were raised; provides examples of available RDF educational resources at various levels, from the very technical to non-technical and introductory; and lists important identifiers used in the publishing ecosystem, documenting which of them are expressed as URIs, and in what sectors and contexts. It recommends that while little new technology is called for, the W3C is in a unique position to bridge today's currently siloed metadata practices to help facilitate truly cross-sector exchange of interoperable metadata. This Note is thus intended to provide background and a context in which concrete work, whether by this Task Force or elsewhere within the W3C, may be undertaken."

    abstract =  "SPARQL is a query language and a protocol for data that is stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware. The main mechanism for computing query results in SPARQL is subgraph matching: RDF triples in both the queried RDF data and the query pattern are interpreted as nodes and edges of directed graphs, and the resulting query graph is matched to the data graph using variables as wild cards. Various W3C standards, including RDF and OWL, provide semantic interpretations for RDF graphs that allow additional RDF statements to be inferred from explicitly given assertions. Many applications that rely on these semantics require a query language such as SPARQL, but in order to use SPARQL, basic graph pattern matching has to be defined using semantic entailment relations instead of explicitly given graph structures. There are different possible ways of defining a basic graph pattern matching extension for an entailment relation. This document specifies one such way for a range of standard semantic web entailment relations. Such extensions of the SPARQL semantics are called entailment regimes within this document. An entailment regime defines not only which entailment relation is used, but also which queries and graphs are well-formed for the regime, how the entailment is used (since there are potentially different meaningful ways to use the same entailment relation), and what kinds of errors can arise. The entailment relations used in this document are standard entailment relations in the semantic web: RDF entailment, RDFS entailment, D-entailment, OWL Direct and RDF-Based Semantics entailment, and RIF Core entailment."

    abstract =  {This document provides an axiomatization for the Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDF-S), and DAML+OIL by specifying a mapping of a set of descriptions in any one of these languages into a logical theory expressed in first-order predicate calculus. The basic claim of this paper is that the logical theory produced by the mapping specified herein of a set of such descriptions is logically equivalent to the intended meaning of that set of descriptions. Providing a means of translating RDF, RDF-S, and DAML+OIL descriptions into a first-order predicate calculus logical theory not only specifies the intended meaning of the descriptions, but also produces a representation of the descriptions from which inferences can automatically be made using traditional automatic theorem provers and problem solvers. For example, the DAML+OIL axioms enable a reasoner to infer from the two statements "Class Male and class Female are disjointWith." and "John is type Male." that the statement "John is type Female." is false. The mapping into predicate calculus consists of a simple rule for translating RDF statements into first-order relational sentences and a set of first-order logic axioms that restrict the allowable interpretations of the non-logical symbols (i.e., relations, functions, and constants) in each language. Since RDF Schema and DAML+OIL are both vocabularies of non-logical symbols added to RDF, the translation of RDF statements is sufficient for translating RDF Schema and DAML+OIL as well. The axioms are written in ANSI Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF)), which is a proposed ANSI standard. The axiomatic semantics are updated as daml+oil evolves and updated versions are available from http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/daml-semantics/abstract-axiomatic-semantics.html. In order to support additional operational usability of the document, we include two additional files: one containing all of the kif axioms and kif theorems in the document.}

Some users and specifications would like to use XML Schema processors which process XML 1.1 documents, and some implementors of XML Schema processors would like to provide XML 1.1 support. This Note suggests an implementation strategy for implementors to adopt to enable users and specifications to get such support in a consistent way. All aspects of XML Schema which are liable to re-interpretation as a result of changes in XML 1.1 are discussed. An implementation of schema-validity assessment employing such a strategy is strictly speaking non-conformant to the current version of the XML Schema specification. The XML Schema WG none-the-less believes that interoperability will best be served by such non-conformant processors being made available to users, until such time as a subsequent version of XML Schema addressing this issue normatively is approved."

Using SMIL, an author can describe the temporal behaviour of a multimedia presentation, associate hyperlinks with media objects and describe the layout of the presentation on a screen. (2) Allow reusing of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based languages, in particular those who need to represent timing and synchronization. For example, SMIL components are used for integrating timing into XHTML and into SVG. (3) Extend the functionalities contained in the SMIL 2.0 into new or revised SMIL 2.1 modules.

For instance, a tag set describing a flowchart could be mapped to low-level SVG path and text elements, possibly including interactivity and animation. sXBL is intended to be an SVG-specific first version of a more general-purpose XBL specification (e.g., "XBL 2.0"). The intent is that, in the future, a general-purpose and modularly-defined XBL specification will be developed which will replace this specification and will define additional features that are necessary to support scenarios beyond SVG, such as integration into web browsers that support CSS. Once a general-purpose XBL is defined, sXBL would just become an SVG-specific subset (i.e., a profile) of the larger XBL specification.}

RDF is primarily for describing resources and their relations, while XLink is primarily for specifying and traversing hyperlinks. However, the overlap between the two is sufficient that a mapping from XLink links to statements in an RDF model can be defined. Such a mapping allows XLink elements to be harvested as a source of RDF statements. XLink links (hereafter, "links") thus provide an alternate syntax for RDF information that may be useful in some situations. This Note specifies such a mapping, so that links can be harvested and RDF statements generated. The purpose of this harvesting is to create RDF models that, in some sense, represent the intent of the XML document. The purpose is not to represent the XLink structure in enough detail that a set of links could be round-tripped through an RDF model.}

It is intended that people first transform their XML documents into XSL-FO, for example using XSLT, and then use an XSL-FO formatter to generate a rendered result, for example in PDF. In this way arbitrary XML documents can be formatted. XSL-FO uses Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) properties, extended where necessary, for the actual format, but also supplies the concept of page templates (page masters, in XSL-FO terminology), and also supports relatively sophisticated document formatting, including index generation."

The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors.

    abstract =  "This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 1, a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how these objects can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and manipulating them. Vendors can support the DOM as an interface to their proprietary data structures and APIs, and content authors can write to the standard DOM interfaces rather than product-specific APIs, thus increasing interoperability on the Web. The goal of the DOM specification is to define a programmatic interface for XML and HTML. The DOM Level 1 specification is separated into two parts: Core and HTML. The Core DOM Level 1 section provides a low-level set of fundamental interfaces that can represent any structured document, as well as defining extended interfaces for representing an XML document. These extended XML interfaces need not be implemented by a DOM implementation that only provides access to HTML documents; all of the fundamental interfaces in the Core section must be implemented. A compliant DOM implementation that implements the extended XML interfaces is required to also implement the fundamental Core interfaces, but not the HTML interfaces. The HTML Level 1 section provides additional, higher-level interfaces that are used with the fundamental interfaces defined in the Core Level 1 section to provide a more convenient view of an HTML document. A compliant implementation of the HTML DOM implements all of the fundamental Core interfaces as well as the HTML interfaces."

Based on current practice and standards, this document specifies mechanisms with which Content Transformation proxies should make their presence known to other parties, present the outcome of alterations performed on HTTP traffic, and react to indications set by clients or servers to constrain these alterations. The objective is to reduce undesirable effects on Web applications, especially mobile-ready ones, and to limit the diversity in the modes of operation of Content Transformation proxies, while at the same time allowing proxies to alter content that would otherwise not display successfully on mobile devices.

    abstract =  "This document describes SOX 2.0, the second version of the Schema for Object-Oriented XML. SOX is a schema language (or metagrammar) for defining the syntactic structure and partial semantics of XML document types. As such, SOX is an alternative to XML DTDs and can be used to define the same class of document types (with the exception of external parsed entities). However, SOX extends the language of DTDs by supporting: 1. An extensive (and extensible) set of datatypes; 2. Inheritance among element types; 3. Namespaces; 4. Polymorphic content; 5. Embedded documentation; 6. Features to enable robust distributed schema management. All of these features are supported with strong type-checking and validation. A SOX schema is also a valid XML instance according to the SOX DTD, enabling the application of XML content management tools to schema management. SOX was initially developed to support the development of large-scale, distributed electronic commerce applications but is applicable across the whole range of applications of markup. As compared to XML DTDs, SOX dramatically decreases the complexity of supporting interoperation among heterogenous applications by facilitating software mapping of XML data structures, expressing domain abstractions and common relationships directly and explicitly, enabling reuse at the document design and the application programming levels, and supporting the generation of common application components. Although SOX 2.0 retains many of the features of SOX 1.0, it represents an additional year of actual implementation experience. Commerce One has a working implementation of this language and will be releasing products based on it. Our goals in releasing this second version are two-fold: 1. Ensure that the public record accurately reflects the evolution of SOX. Members of the community wishing to understand SOX, build tools using SOX, or interoperate with SOX applications, need access to the current version of the language. 2. Expose some of the fruits of our implementation experience to the general community, particularly to assist in the ongoing work at the W3C to develop an official XML Schema language. From the markup world, the SOX proposal is informed by the XML 1.0 specification as well as the XML-Data submission and the Document Content Description submission. However many of SOX' requirements come from the distributed computing world and SOX features have been heavily influenced by the Java programming language."

CSS 2.1 is a style sheet language that allows authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, CSS 2.1 simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance. CSS 2.1 builds on CSS2 which builds on CSS1. It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices, printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization and some properties related to user interface. CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new calculation of the 'clip' property), and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a "snapshot" of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation. CSS 2.1 is derived from and is intended to replace CSS2. Some parts of CSS2 are unchanged in CSS 2.1, some parts have been altered, and some parts removed. The removed portions may be used in a future CSS3 specification. Future specs should refer to CSS 2.1 (unless they need features from CSS2 which have been dropped in CSS 2.1, and then they should only reference CSS2 for those features, or preferably reference such feature(s) in the respective CSS3 Module that includes those feature(s)).}

This Note contains experimental ideas for layout templates and alternative layout models in CSS. At the moment, it defines a typographic grid for CSS. It has features to set up a grid-based template, to style the slots of the template and to flow content into them. A grid template can be seen as a cross between table layout (align blocks of text automatically in two-dimensions) and absolute positioning (position elements in arbitrary order), but it also has unique features of its own. Grid templates can also be associated with pages in paged media (via '@page'), to create page templates. Slots can form chains, to create non-rectangular regions. A chain of slots is like a series of small pages: content is broken at possible page breaks and distributed over the slots. Region-based styling allows content to be styled not only based on its position in the document tree, but also based on the slot it finds itself in. This is achieved by allowing slot names to appear in selectors.}

    abstract =  "Filter effects are a way of processing an element's rendering before it is displayed in the document. Typically, rendering an element via CSS or SVG can be conceptually described as if the element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer (such as a raster image) and then that buffer is composited into the elements parent. Filters apply an effect before the compositing stage. Examples of such effects are blurring, changing color intensity and warping the image. Although originally designed for use in SVG, filter effects are a set of operations to apply on an image buffer and therefore can be applied to nearly any presentational environment, including CSS. They are triggered by a style instruction (the 'filter' property). This specification describes filters in a manner that allows them to be used in content styled by CSS, such as HTML and SVG. It also defines a CSS property value function that produces a CSS <image> value."

For such exploration to be productive, information published by many different sources and for a variety of purposes must be comprehensible to a wide range of Web client software, and to users of that software. HTTP and other Web technologies can be used to deploy resource representations that are self-describing: information about the encodings used for each representation is provided explicitly within the representation. Starting with a URI, there is a standard algorithm that a user agent can apply to retrieve and interpret such representations. Furthermore, representations can be what we refer to as grounded in the Web, by ensuring that specifications required to interpret them are determined unambiguously based on the URI, and that explicit references connect the pertinent specifications to each other. Web-grounding ensures that the specifications needed to interpret information on the Web can be identified unambiguously. When such self-describing, Web-grounded resources are linked together, the Web as a whole can support reliable, ad hoc discovery of information. This finding describes how document formats, markup conventions, attribute values, and other data formats can be designed to facilitate the deployment of self-describing, Web-grounded Web content."

When supported by the communication protocol, the Web architecture uses representation metadata to indicate the sender's intentions regarding how the recipient should interpret the representation data. For example, HTTP and MIME use the value of the "Content-Type" header field to indicate the Internet media type of the representation, which influences the dispatching of handlers and security-related decisions made by recipients of the message. In this finding, we review the architectural design choice that metadata provided in an encapsulating container, such as the metadata provided in the header fields of a received message, be considered authoritative. We examine why recipient behavior that fails to respect authoritative metadata can be harmful and under what conditions such behavior is allowed. Finally, we consider how specification authors and implementers should incorporate these design constraints into their work.}

    abstract =  {As the Web has evolved from a Web of documents to a Web of applications, techniques for designing applications so that application state and document views of application state can be identified and bookmarked have evolved correspondingly. Originally introduced as a static "fragment identifier" to identify locations in a document, the hash sign, #, is now being used to identify application states as well as in other interesting ways, for example, by SVG and PDF to select from and render documents and as arguments to Web applications that are interpreted by JavaScript. Fragment identifiers are used to provide several different kinds of parameters to the client-side application, such as the actual URI of a video to be played to a video player, or the position and zoom to a map. In many widely deployed browsers, changing the scheme, path or query string in a URI causes an unconditional page reload, but changes to the fragment identifier do not: the characters in the URI bar after the # can be changed without incurring the overhead of reloading the page. Applications and toolkits using fragment identifiers in this way often go to some effort to maintain a history and make sure the back button works as expected. Accessibility and search can, however, be compromised, because without running JavaScript, the URI has no meaning. Such uses of the "fragment identifier" have interesting and different properties, and the usage differs from the way it is described in existing specifications. Recently added functionality in HTML5 (history.pushState() and history.replaceState()) allows browser history to be changed without causing a page reload thereby providing an alternative to the use of fragment identifiers to identify application state. Many Web applications are used to present or edit documents. Such applications should be designed so that the documents are readily identified with URIs that can be used for linking from other Web pages or transmitted in e-mails or used in copy/paste situations. This document explores the issues that arise from these new uses of fragment identifiers and attempts to define best practices. We argue that, in many cases, the use of query parameters along with the new HTML5 functionality mentioned above is preferable to fragment identifiers to identify application state.}

This API can also be leveraged by web applications running on mobile devices that access the data resources of a connected passenger vehicle. This specification does not dictate or describe the access protocol or transport method used for the data connection. Data may come from numerous sources including OBD-II, CAN, LIN, etc. Bluetooth, WiFi, or cloud connections are all possible. The purpose of this specification is to promote an API that enables application development in a consistent manner across participating automotive manufacturers. It is recognized, however, that the mechanisms required for access or control of vehicle Properties may differ between automobile manufacturers, makes and models. Furthermore, different automobile manufacturers can expose different Properties that can be read or set by an application. As a result of these constraints, this specification shall allow for automobile manufacturer-specific extensions or restrictions. Extensions are only permitted for interfaces that are not already described by this API, and must be implemented to conform within the format and guidelines existing in this specification. If a Property is restricted, the automobile manufacturer would omit the optional feature in their implementation (see the Availability Section). The target platform supported by the specification is exclusively passenger vehicles. Use of this specification for non-passenger applications (transportation, heavy machinery, marine, airline infotainment, military, etc.) is not prohibited, but is not covered in the design or content of the API and therefore may be insufficient. Initially, a typical use case of Vehicle Information might be the implementation of a 'Virtual Mechanic' application that provides vehicle status information such as tire pressure, engine oil level, washer fluid level, battery status, etc. Future use case innovations in transportation, safety, navigation, smart energy grid and consumer infotainment and customization are all possible through this specification. Web developers building interoperable applications based upon this API, will help empower a common web platform across consumer devices and passenger vehicles consistent with the Web of Things."

    abstract =  {Some user agents have music devices, such as synthesizers, keyboard and other controllers, and drum machines connected to their host computer or device. The widely adopted Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol enables electronic musical instruments, controllers and computers to communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical notes, controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific MIDI communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch data). This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses, such as show control, lighting and special effects control. This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems. The Web MIDI API is not intended to describe music or controller inputs semantically; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically (e.g., in terms of "modulate the vibrato by 20Hz" or "play a G#7 chord", other than in terms of changing a controller value or sending a set of note-on messages that happen to represent a G#7 chord). To some users, "MIDI" has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files and General MIDI. That is not the intent of this API; the use case of simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this specification (it could be considered a different format to be supported by the HTML5 <audio> element, for example). The Web MIDI API is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI - external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example, or even the software synthesizers that are built in to many common operating systems. The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs - using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind instrument controllers) to control web applications. The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API. This API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.}

It can also include information such as the system notifying the application when the type of connection changes from one type to another (e.g., from cellular to Wi-Fi). To create this document, we examined a range of applications across popular platforms to see how they make use of network information - particularly as it affects users. It also looks at how these applications respond to changes to network types and conditions. By looking at these applications we've come up with a set of requirements. We hope that the W3C community can address these requirements by creating a specification that affords similar functionality to the web platform. The document concludes with a discussion of why exposing certain values would not be helpful to the design of an Network Information API. It also discusses some alternative approaches to how the use cases could be addressed without requiring an API."

    abstract =  {This specification provides an API for representing file objects in web applications, as well as programmatically selecting them and accessing their data. This includes: A FileList interface, which represents an array of individually selected files from the underlying system. The user interface for selection can be invoked via <input type="file">, i.e. when the input element is in the File Upload state; A Blob interface, which represents immutable raw binary data, and allows access to ranges of bytes within the Blob object as a separate Blob; A File interface, which includes readonly informational attributes about a file such as its name and the date of the last modification (on disk) of the file; A FileReader interface, which provides methods to read a File or a Blob, and an event model to obtain the results of these reads; A URI scheme for use with binary data such as files, so that they can be referenced within web applications. Additionally, this specification defines objects to be used within threaded web applications for the synchronous reading of files. The section on Requirements and Use Cases covers the motivation behind this specification. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest (e.g. with an overloaded send() method for File or Blob objects), postMessage, DataTransfer (part of the drag and drop API defined in HTML) and Web Workers. Additionally, it should be possible to programmatically obtain a list of files from the input element when it is in the File Upload state. These kinds of behaviors are defined in the appropriate affiliated specifications.}

The challenge of crafting a protocol specification is to create a description of behaviour that is not tied to any particular approach to implementation. There is a need to abstract away from some of the messy implementation details of buffer management, data representation and specific APIs. However, in order to describe the behaviour of a protocol one has to establish a set of (useful) concepts that can be used in that description. An abstract model is one way to establish a consistent set of concepts. An abstract model is a tool for the description of complex behaviour --- it is not a template for an implementation... although it should not stray so far away from reality that it is impossible to recognise how the required behaviours would be implemented."

The measurements have been conducted following the recommendations of the XML Binary Characterization (XBC) Working Group. In particular, this draft covers measurements of the properties of "compactness", "processing efficiency" and "roundtrip support", as defined by the XBC WG. We start by describing the context in which this analysis is being made, and the position of an efficient format in the landscape of high performance XML strategies. Then we describe the measured quantities in detail and the test framework in which they were made, and give a short description of each format. Finally, a summary of the results and the conclusions of the group are included. The full measurements and analysis are included in an appendix and supporting documents. As a result of the measurements described here, the working group selected "Efficient XML" to be the basis for the proposed encoding specification to be prepared as a candidate W3C Recommendation. Follow up work has centered around integrating some features from the other measured format technologies, particularly variations for both more efficient structural and value encodings.}

Temporal addressing enables, e.g., direct access to a clip inside a video stored on a Web Server, or direct jumps to a specific event within a piece of music. The syntax is not restricted to audio or video Web resources though, but covers all kinds of Web resources that contain time-continuous information. When a server (e.g. a Web Server) supports the URI query syntax, it is able to extract the given time subsections from the base resource and serve them as another resource of the same type. Specifying a time point or interval through a URI fragment in contrast does not deliver a subpart of the resource --- instead it is up to the user agent and the resource type as to what action is invoked. Examples are a fast forward to a time point, or a zoom into a time interval."

The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained environments."

    topic =     "rpc[1]",
    abstract =  {The principal goal of all resource-sharing computer networks, including the now international ARPA Network (the ARPANET), is to usefully interconnect geographically distributed hardware, software, and human resources. Achieving this goal requires the design and implementation of various levels of support software within each constituent computer, and the specification of network-wide "protocols" (that is, conventions regarding the format and the relative timing of network messages) governing their interaction. This paper outlines an alternative to the approach that ARPANET system builders have been taking since work in this area began in 1970, and suggests a strategy for modeling distributed systems within any large computer network. The first section of this paper describes the prevailing ARPANET protocol strategy, which involves specifying a family of application-dependent protocols with a network-wide inter-process communication facility as their common foundation. In the second section, the application-independent command/response discipline that characterizes this protocol family is identified and its isolation as a separate protocol proposed. Such isolation would reduce the work of the applications programmer by allowing the software that implements the protocol to be factored out of each applications program and supplied as a single, installation-maintained module. The final section of this paper proposes an extensible model for this class of network interaction that in itself would even further encourage the use of network resources.}

However, Internet mail (STD 11, RFC 822) currently supports only 7-bit US ASCII as a character set. MIME (RFC 2045 through 2049) extends Internet mail to support different media types and character sets, and thus could support Unicode in mail messages. MIME neither defines Unicode as a permitted character set nor specifies how it would be encoded, although it does provide for the registration of additional character sets over time. This document describes a transformation format of Unicode that contains only 7-bit ASCII octets and is intended to be readable by humans in the limiting case that the document consists of characters from the US-ASCII repertoire. It also specifies how this transformation format is used in the context of MIME and RFC 1641, "Using Unicode with MIME".}

Current group scheduling and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This memo has been defined to provide the definition of a common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the Internet. This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable for use outside of a MIME message content type. The proposed media type value is 'text/calendar'. This string would label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below. This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing calendar event, to-do and journal entry information. It also can be used to convey free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems, using HTTP or some other Internet transport. In addition, the content type is useful as an object for interactions between desktop applications using the operating system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities. This memo is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar specification for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling information. In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work, this memo is to be known as the iCalendar specification. This memo defines the format for specifying iCalendar object methods. An iCalendar object method is a set of usage constraints for the iCalendar object. For example, these methods might define scheduling messages that request an event be scheduled, reply to an event request, send a cancelation notice for an event, modify or replace the definition of an event, provide a counter proposal for an original event request, delegate an event request to another individual, request free or busy time, reply to a free or busy time request, or provide similar scheduling messages for a to-do or journal entry calendar component. The iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) is one such scheduling protocol."

    abstract =  "This document is a self-contained specification of the basic protocol for the Internet electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates and clarifies, but doesn't add new or change existing functionality of the following: The original SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) specification of RFC 821, domain name system requirements and implications for mail transport from RFC 1035 and RFC 974, the clarifications and applicability statements in RFC 1123, and material drawn from the SMTP Extension mechanisms. It obsoletes RFC 821, RFC 974, and updates RFC 1123 (replaces the mail transport materials of RFC 1123). However, RFC 821 specifies some features that were not in significant use in the Internet by the mid-1990s and (in appendices) some additional transport models. Those sections are omitted here in the interest of clarity and brevity; readers needing them should refer to RFC 821. It also includes some additional material from RFC 1123 that required amplification. This material has been identified in multiple ways, mostly by tracking flaming on various lists and newsgroups and problems of unusual readings or interpretations that have appeared as the SMTP extensions have been deployed. Where this specification moves beyond consolidation and actually differs from earlier documents, it supersedes them technically as well as textually. Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important to its use as a 'mail submission' protocol, as recommended for POP and IMAP. Additional submission issues are discussed in RFC 2476. Section 2.3 provides definitions of terms specific to this document. Except when the historical terminology is necessary for clarity, this document uses the current 'client' and 'server' terminology to identify the sending and receiving SMTP processes, respectively. A companion document discusses message headers, message bodies and formats and structures for them, and their relationship."

The mechanism described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC 3204. By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services to systems of lesser capability. Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what parts to forward. It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to deliver a body part. It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message. In addition, critical content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving system. Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the receiver must process."

Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.

By labeling content with the specific codecs indicated to render the contained media, receiving systems can determine if the codecs are supported by the end system, and if not, can take appropriate action (such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the situation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and installing the required codecs, further inspection to determine if it will be sufficient to support a subset of the indicated codecs, etc.). Similarly, the profiles can provide an overall indication, to the receiver, of the specifications with which the content complies. This is an indication of the compatibility of the container format and its contents to some specification. The receiver may be able to work out the extent to which it can handle and render the content by examining to see which of the declared profiles it supports, and what they mean."

The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types.

In one embodiment, the method includes retrieving over a first communication connection, in response to a request of a client computer, informational content having computer program code embedded therein, and executing the embedded computer program code for establishing a second communication connection to an application server. The method further includes retrieving over the second communication connection first information including presentational information for presenting the application and the second information. The method also includes presenting the application and the second information based upon the presentational information, and storing on the client computer an interactive link for selectively re-establishing the second communication connection to the application server for retrieving the first information and presenting the application and the second information on an as-needed basis. Preferably, the storing of the interactive link includes downloading a graphical representation of the interactive link and storing a file containing information representing an operating environment of the client computer and a network address of the application server."

    abstract =  {An open, simple, web-scale pubsub protocol, along with an open source reference implentation targetting Google App Engine. Notably, however, nothing in the protocol is centralized, or Google- or App Engine-specific. Anybody can play. As opposed to more developed (and more complex) pubsub specs like Jabber Publish-Subscribe this spec's base profile (the barrier-to-entry to speak it) is dead simple. The fancy bits required for high-volume publishers and subscribers are optional. The base profile is HTTP-based, as opposed to XMPP (see more on this below). To dramatically simplify this spec in several places where we had to choose between supporting A or B, we took it upon ourselves to say "only A", rather than making it an implementation decision. We offer this spec in hopes that it fills a need or at least advances the state of the discussion in the pubsub space. Polling sucks. We think a decentralized pubsub layer is a fundamental, missing layer in the Internet architecture today and its existence, more than just enabling the obvious lower latency feed readers, would enable many cool applications, most of which we can't even imagine. But we're looking forward to decentralized social networking.}

This is a subset of the full HTTP protocol, and is known as HTTP 0.9. No client profile information is transferred with the query. Future HTTP protocols will be back-compatible with this protocol. This restricted protocol is very simple and may always be used when you do not need the capabilities of the full protocol which is backwards compatible. The definition of this protocol is in the public domain. The protocol uses the normal internet-style telnet protocol style on a TCP-IP link. The following describes how a client acquires a (hypertext) document from an HTTP server, given an HTTP document address."
